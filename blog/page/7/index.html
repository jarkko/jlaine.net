  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>[<span class="caps">UPDATE</span>]</strong> Should have knocked the wood a few times more. We were on Kottke and TechCrunch just about the same time, and man, that shows. A new server is on its way, but before that, please bare with us.</p>
<p>Almost forgot to blog about this in the heat of everything: <a href="http://dotherightthing.com">we&#8217;re live!</a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a terrific feeling, to see something you built in real use. I&#8217;m very happy and proud for the whole team. Thanks guys!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s nice to see that after the initial shyness people have started posting their own stories, too. We were also mentioned yesterday in <a href="http://www.treehugger.com/files/2007/01/dotherightthing.php">Treehugger</a> and <a href="http://www.hugg.com/story/dotherightthing-Social-Networking-Meets-Corporate-Social-Performance/">got hugg</a>. Those created some nice traffic but we&#8217;re still waiting for the big hit to come, though, so fingers crossed the system won&#8217;t melt down.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t yet visited the site, check it out. I personally feel it has a huge potential to be the place where people go before purchasing stuff to see how the seller or producer treats its customers, employees, environment and the community. Our goal is also to get companies to participate in the discussion, in a true <a href="http://www.cluetrain.com">cluetrain fashion</a>. And the more people participate, the more useful the site is for everyone. And the sooner to sign up, the bigger chance you have to grab a really cool username ;-)</p>
<p>When the situation cools down a bit, I will start a series of articles about the technology and other background details behind the site. So stay tuned!</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Anyone worth calling herself a web developer has probably used some kind of an image replacement technique during her career. You know, replacing a page header text with an image, still keeping the <span class="caps">HTML</span> structure semantic and accessible.</p>
<p>One of the most common image replacement technique is called the <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/tests/revised-image-replacement/#phark2">Revised Phark technique</a>, named after <a href="http://phark.typepad.com/">Mike &laquo;Phark&raquo; Rundle</a>. The idea of the technique is that using the text-indent <span class="caps">CSS</span> property the heading text is placed so far away from the visible area that it is never shown:</p>
<pre><code>#replace {
  text-indent: -5000px;
  background: url(/background.png) 0 0 no-repeat;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The good thing about this technique is that it doesn&#8217;t require any extraneous elements to get the effect, thus making it very straight-forward and easy to grasp. On the other hand, it doesn&#8217;t work for the odd people that keep <span class="caps">CSS</span> on but images off. I can&#8217;t think of a reason to do that (except for mobile browsers but they can be treated with a separate stylesheet), so I wouldn&#8217;t consider it a big issue.</p>
<p>However, there is an annoying issue if you use use the Phark technique with an anchor element, something you very often do with the main page header. When you click on the link, it will have a dotted narrow border that will go on to the edge of the screen:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jarkko/366928823/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/162/366928823_d5486f8cd0_o.png" width="529" height="263" alt="Outline issue with the Phark method" /></a></p>
<p>A few days ago I was reading Andy Clarke&#8217;s excellent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Transcending-CSS-Design-Voices-Matter/dp/0321410971/">Transcending <span class="caps">CSS</span></a> and on page 279 it mentioned the outline <span class="caps">CSS</span> property of which I&#8217;d never heard. I wasn&#8217;t very impressed about its usefulness, but somehow it got me thinking. What if that&#8217;s the blot on the Phark landscape? And lo and behold, it was!</p>
<p>Just by adding</p>
<pre><code>  outline: 0;
</code></pre>
<p>to the css rule used for the image replacement fixed it. No more those &#8220;What the hell is there on the left where I can&#8217;t get?&#8221; moments on my pages.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Rails Revelations: How Rails made me a better programmer</h2>
<p>For me, the spell of Rails comes roughly in three parts:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Productivity boost</li>
	<li>Having more fun</li>
	<li>Doing the right things</li>
</ol>
<p>Number 1 has been the reason numero uno almost everywhere Rails has been mentioned. I guess it&#8217;s easier to sell productivity to managers than having fun (&#8220;oh, that&#8217;s so unprofessional!&#8221;) or doing the right things without rigid explicit processes. However, I see the increased productivity mostly as an inevitable consequence of the two latter points.</p>
<p>Much of my liking Ruby and Rails development more than other environments comes from the feeling of the language and tools being a natural extension of my brain. Why shouldn&#8217;t I be able to write something like <code>2.weeks.ago</code>? It&#8217;s easy to dismiss things like that as just syntactic sugar without real meaning, but you know, things add up, and overall happiness in work is built of small details.</p>
<p>Point number three could be described as the dullest and most minor benefit Rails brings to table. However, in many ways it&#8217;s the grounding factor of both the happy Rails development and the improved productivity.</p>
<p>The things I include in doing the right things are stuff like making testing as easy as not to, conforming to the Rest principles and naming conventions, the <span class="caps">MVC</span>-type separation of concerns, and keeping yourself <acronym title="don&#39;t repeat yourself"><span class="caps">DRY</span></acronym>. I sleep my nights much better when I know that my application has extensive test coverage and that anyone knowledgeable with Rails can take it up in a few hours in case we need more labour force because the structure of the application is so obvious.</p>
<p>Now, none of these things are specific to or even popularized by Rails. However, many web developers have come to learn these lessons through Rails and I don&#8217;t know any other framework that would make them as integrated part of the development process as Rails does. As the king of the Rails kingdom, David Heinemeier Hansson, has said, Rails tries to be the angel on the developer&#8217;s shoulder (&#8220;Write your tests, it&#8217;s as easy as not to!&#8221;) as opposed to the <span class="caps">PHP</span> devil (&#8220;<span class="caps">SQL</span> in the views, quick&#8217;n&#8217;dirty, man!&#8221;).</p>
<p>However, my imagination is very limited and I&#8217;d like to hear more about what healthy habits Rails has made people learn and what bad habits to abandon. That&#8217;s why the topic of our January blogging contest is &#8220;Rails Revelations: How Rails made me a better programmer&#8221;. Heck, if Rails made you quit smoking, <a href="http://on-ruby.blogspot.com/2007/01/win-books-by-blogging.html">tell us about it</a>.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just upgraded my <a href="http://www.caminobrowser.org/">browser of choice</a> to the <a href="http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/camino/nightly/latest-trunk/">latest nightly build</a>. Camino 1.0.3 has been anything but stable recently so I wondered the latest bugfixes can hardly make it worse. I got the spark from <a href="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk">Mr. Hicks</a> who had a <a href="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/cairo-beats-safari">comparison</a> between how the new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cairo_%28graphics%29">Cairo rendering engine</a>, Safari and the old Camino render light text on a dark background.</p>
<p>Of course, it will come with some other new goodies, too, like (finally) a <span class="caps">RSS</span> feed icon in the address bar, <a href="http://www.actsofvolition.com/archives/2006/december/cairocornersin">nice rounded corners</a> and automatic spell checking in forms.</p>
<p>So far the build of December 19 has been rock-solid (for a whopping hour ;-), so no complaints. And the new text rendering <strong>is</strong> nice.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When developing <a href="http://dotherightthing.com">dotherightthing.com</a>, it&#8217;s been a real <span class="caps">PITA</span> to develop for Internet Explorer. I&#8217;m working on a Mac and have to do the Windows testing on the _gf_&#8217;s laptop. After I installed IE7 on the box, there was no easy way to run version 6 on it anymore. However, IE6 and IE7 both have their quirks which are, of course, completely different from one another.  As sad as it might be, IE6 is still the most popular browser on the market, so the situation was untenable.</p>
<p>I tried to use a standalone IE6 from the <a href="http://browsers.evolt.org/">Browser Archive</a>, but unfortunately I couldn&#8217;t even login to our dev system using it. It seems that it really isn&#8217;t that standalone and gets the cookies somehow mixed up (or doesn&#8217;t accept them at all, dunno), so the value of it was practically zero.</p>
<p>Luckily, for once something really useful from the MS land: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2006/11/30/ie6-and-ie7-running-on-a-single-machine.aspx">IE6 and IE7 Running on a Single Machine</a>: free Virtual PC 2004 + a virtual machine for testing on IE6. Haven&#8217;t yet tested it but it sounds cool enough for small teams that don&#8217;t want to spend on Parallels + a Windows license or another Windows machine just for debugging the IE6 hell.</p>
