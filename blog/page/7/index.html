  <div class="entry-content"><p>We just went live with a <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch15_One_Month_Tuneup.php">three week tuneup</a> at <a href="http://dotherightthing.com">dotherightthing.com</a>. The main update is the introduction of a wide variety of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_feed">Atom feeds</a>. I just wrote an &#8220;in-depth article about all the different feeds available on the dotherighthing.com blog&#8221;:, but let me get a bit more geeky here.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re using <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> and the <a href="http://ryandaigle.com/articles/2006/08/01/whats-new-in-edge-rails-simply-restful-support-and-how-to-use-it">Simply Restful</a> stuff in it so adding an Atom representation for a resource like entry, company or user is dead simple: just add a new response type with respond_to:</p>
<pre><code>  respond_to do |type|
    type.html do
      # normal stuff
    end
    type.atom do
      # render the atom feed
    end
  end
</code></pre>
<p>Now, when someone requests the action with type atom (e.g. <a href="http://dotherightthing.com/companies/starbucks.atom">http://dotherightthing.com/companies/starbucks.atom</a>), the code inside <code>type.atom</code> will be executed. However, the niceties don&#8217;t stop there. The new <a href="http://www.ryandaigle.com/articles/2006/09/14/whats-new-in-edge-rails-get-your-rss-atom-feeds-for-free">resource_feeder</a> plugin makes everything even easier. We don&#8217;t need to setup a specific template for the feeds at all, all we have to do is to specify some options that don&#8217;t match the standard and then call render_atom_feed_for:</p>
<pre><code>  feed_options = { :feed =&gt; 
                      {:title =&gt; "dotherightthing.com #{params[:sort]} entries",
                       :link =&gt; entries_url(:sort =&gt; params[:sort])},
                   :item =&gt; {:description =&gt; :body_html},
                   :class =&gt; Entry }

                   ...

  type.atom do
    render_atom_feed_for(@entries, feed_options)
  end
</code></pre>
<p>And that&#8217;s it!</p>
<p>Another great thing about Simply Restful is that all the url&#8217;s are extremely logical. A user profile can be viewed at <a href="http://dotherightthing.com/users/jarkko">http://dotherightthing.com/users/jarkko</a>, a feed for his content is at <a href="http://dotherightthing.com/users/jarkko.atom">http://dotherightthing.com/users/jarkko.atom</a>. The same is true for companies: <a href="http://dotherightthing.com/companies/apple">http://dotherightthing.com/companies/apple</a> â†’ <a href="http://dotherightthing.com/companies/apple.atom">http://dotherightthing.com/companies/apple.atom</a>.</p>
<p>Gotta love the RESTful features in Rails!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jarkko/382599906/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/133/382599906_8de94ec343_m.jpg" width="240" height="166" alt="My new Mirra" /></a></p>
<p>After our trip to Paris and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jarkko/sets/72157594520608975/">EuroCabooseConf</a> I brought home my new office chair, a <a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/mirra/">Herman Miller Mirra</a>. I&#8217;ve been looking for a good chair for quite a while, but have been postponing the purchase because of the low availability. In Finland you basically have to travel to Helsinki if you have to test drive anything more obscure than a very basic office chair.</p>
<p>After giving a workshop in Helsinki last week I finally took the plunge and went to visit the only HM representative in Finland. And boy was I sold.</p>
<p>Mirra has been on the top of my list for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
	<li>It is a lot easier to adjust than Aeron and fits most people by default.</li>
	<li>It costs only about 2/3 of the price of Aeron (or Freedom Chair, which has even worse sales network in Finland).</li>
	<li>It is, according to Bill McDonough (the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FCradle-Remaking-Way-Make-Things%2Fdp%2F0865475873%2F&amp;tag=jlainenet-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Cradle to Cradle</a>),  &#8220;the most advanced and thorough application of Cradle-to-Cradle principles a furniture maker has ever brought to the market.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>After testing the chair the deal was pretty much done. Mirra is plain and simple the best chair I&#8217;ve ever used. It offers just the right amount of support and free movement you&#8217;ll need if you have to spend hours each day sitting in one place.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jarkko/382635315/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/169/382635315_15fc5f60a3_m.jpg" width="160" height="240" alt="New chair" /></a></p>
<p>But Mirra is not just a great chair. By buying it I also felt like <a href="http://dotherightthing.com">doing the right thing</a>. The initial four aspects we had when building <a href="http://dotherightthing.com">dotherightthing.com</a> were <em>customer, community, employees and environment</em>. I feel that Herman Miller takes all these four aspects into account in its business, maybe better than any other company.</p>
<p>Good things for me as a customer:</p>
<ul>
	<li>I got the best chair I&#8217;ve ever used.</li>
	<li>Mirra is an extremely low-emitting product, meeting the <a href="http://greenguard.org/"><span class="caps">GREENGUARD</span>^TM^</a> standards. This results in better indoor air quality.</li>
	<li>Mirra is of really high quality (&#8220;Number One design and environmental criteria: Durability.&#8221;) and equipped with a 12-year warranty, work included.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good things for the environment in general (some highlights from the Mirra <a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/hm/content/category/about_us/EPS_MIR.pdf">Environmental Product Summary</a>):</p>
<ul>
	<li>The Mirra chair is up to 96 percent recyclable at the end of its useful life.</li>
	<li>Mirra is comprised of 42 percent recycled materials.</li>
	<li>Every material has been scrutinized down to the molecular level.</li>
	<li>Steel components can be segregated and returned to the recycling stream as a technical nutrient.</li>
	<li>No polyvinyl chloride (<span class="caps">PVC</span>) used; thermoplastic elastimer is used for arm skin.</li>
	<li>Molded polymer back can be recycled up to 25 times.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jarkko/382635218/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/145/382635218_4d3d37afc1_m.jpg" width="240" height="160" alt="New chair" /></a></p>
<ul>
	<li>&#8230;and much more, see the <a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/hm/content/category/about_us/EPS_MIR.pdf">summary for details</a>. Following the Cradle to Cradle approach, Mirra is designed from the ground-up not to be less bad for the environment, but rather eliminate the bad side effects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good things for the environment, employees and the local community around the factory:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The Holland, Michigan based Herman Miller &#8220;<a href="http://www.mcdonoughpartners.com/projects/hmi/default.asp?projID=hmi">Greenhouse</a>&#8221; factory is one of the first designed by <a href="http://www.mcdonough.com/writings/anatomy_transformation.htm">Bill McDonough according to his Cradle to Cradle principles</a>:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The GreenHouse&#8221; provides an urbane, pleasant environment for all employees; copious fresh air and sunlight; easy access between administrative and manufacturing staff; and natural features such as wetlands and swales that purify storm water run-off and provide habitat for local birds, flowers, and grasses. The result: a measured increase in productivity, a measured increase in the degree of job satisfaction, and a measured array of positive social and ecological impacts. In fact, the building won Business Week&#8217;s first &#8220;Good Design is Good Business&#8221; award for its documented impacts on the top and bottom line.</p>
</blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>[<span class="caps">UPDATE</span>]</strong> Should have knocked the wood a few times more. We were on Kottke and TechCrunch just about the same time, and man, that shows. A new server is on its way, but before that, please bare with us.</p>
<p>Almost forgot to blog about this in the heat of everything: <a href="http://dotherightthing.com">we&#8217;re live!</a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a terrific feeling, to see something you built in real use. I&#8217;m very happy and proud for the whole team. Thanks guys!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s nice to see that after the initial shyness people have started posting their own stories, too. We were also mentioned yesterday in <a href="http://www.treehugger.com/files/2007/01/dotherightthing.php">Treehugger</a> and <a href="http://www.hugg.com/story/dotherightthing-Social-Networking-Meets-Corporate-Social-Performance/">got hugg</a>. Those created some nice traffic but we&#8217;re still waiting for the big hit to come, though, so fingers crossed the system won&#8217;t melt down.</p>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t yet visited the site, check it out. I personally feel it has a huge potential to be the place where people go before purchasing stuff to see how the seller or producer treats its customers, employees, environment and the community. Our goal is also to get companies to participate in the discussion, in a true <a href="http://www.cluetrain.com">cluetrain fashion</a>. And the more people participate, the more useful the site is for everyone. And the sooner to sign up, the bigger chance you have to grab a really cool username ;-)</p>
<p>When the situation cools down a bit, I will start a series of articles about the technology and other background details behind the site. So stay tuned!</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Anyone worth calling herself a web developer has probably used some kind of an image replacement technique during her career. You know, replacing a page header text with an image, still keeping the <span class="caps">HTML</span> structure semantic and accessible.</p>
<p>One of the most common image replacement technique is called the <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/tests/revised-image-replacement/#phark2">Revised Phark technique</a>, named after <a href="http://phark.typepad.com/">Mike &laquo;Phark&raquo; Rundle</a>. The idea of the technique is that using the text-indent <span class="caps">CSS</span> property the heading text is placed so far away from the visible area that it is never shown:</p>
<pre><code>#replace {
  text-indent: -5000px;
  background: url(/background.png) 0 0 no-repeat;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The good thing about this technique is that it doesn&#8217;t require any extraneous elements to get the effect, thus making it very straight-forward and easy to grasp. On the other hand, it doesn&#8217;t work for the odd people that keep <span class="caps">CSS</span> on but images off. I can&#8217;t think of a reason to do that (except for mobile browsers but they can be treated with a separate stylesheet), so I wouldn&#8217;t consider it a big issue.</p>
<p>However, there is an annoying issue if you use use the Phark technique with an anchor element, something you very often do with the main page header. When you click on the link, it will have a dotted narrow border that will go on to the edge of the screen:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jarkko/366928823/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/162/366928823_d5486f8cd0_o.png" width="529" height="263" alt="Outline issue with the Phark method" /></a></p>
<p>A few days ago I was reading Andy Clarke&#8217;s excellent <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Transcending-CSS-Design-Voices-Matter/dp/0321410971/">Transcending <span class="caps">CSS</span></a> and on page 279 it mentioned the outline <span class="caps">CSS</span> property of which I&#8217;d never heard. I wasn&#8217;t very impressed about its usefulness, but somehow it got me thinking. What if that&#8217;s the blot on the Phark landscape? And lo and behold, it was!</p>
<p>Just by adding</p>
<pre><code>  outline: 0;
</code></pre>
<p>to the css rule used for the image replacement fixed it. No more those &#8220;What the hell is there on the left where I can&#8217;t get?&#8221; moments on my pages.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Rails Revelations: How Rails made me a better programmer</h2>
<p>For me, the spell of Rails comes roughly in three parts:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Productivity boost</li>
	<li>Having more fun</li>
	<li>Doing the right things</li>
</ol>
<p>Number 1 has been the reason numero uno almost everywhere Rails has been mentioned. I guess it&#8217;s easier to sell productivity to managers than having fun (&#8220;oh, that&#8217;s so unprofessional!&#8221;) or doing the right things without rigid explicit processes. However, I see the increased productivity mostly as an inevitable consequence of the two latter points.</p>
<p>Much of my liking Ruby and Rails development more than other environments comes from the feeling of the language and tools being a natural extension of my brain. Why shouldn&#8217;t I be able to write something like <code>2.weeks.ago</code>? It&#8217;s easy to dismiss things like that as just syntactic sugar without real meaning, but you know, things add up, and overall happiness in work is built of small details.</p>
<p>Point number three could be described as the dullest and most minor benefit Rails brings to table. However, in many ways it&#8217;s the grounding factor of both the happy Rails development and the improved productivity.</p>
<p>The things I include in doing the right things are stuff like making testing as easy as not to, conforming to the Rest principles and naming conventions, the <span class="caps">MVC</span>-type separation of concerns, and keeping yourself <acronym title="don&#39;t repeat yourself"><span class="caps">DRY</span></acronym>. I sleep my nights much better when I know that my application has extensive test coverage and that anyone knowledgeable with Rails can take it up in a few hours in case we need more labour force because the structure of the application is so obvious.</p>
<p>Now, none of these things are specific to or even popularized by Rails. However, many web developers have come to learn these lessons through Rails and I don&#8217;t know any other framework that would make them as integrated part of the development process as Rails does. As the king of the Rails kingdom, David Heinemeier Hansson, has said, Rails tries to be the angel on the developer&#8217;s shoulder (&#8220;Write your tests, it&#8217;s as easy as not to!&#8221;) as opposed to the <span class="caps">PHP</span> devil (&#8220;<span class="caps">SQL</span> in the views, quick&#8217;n&#8217;dirty, man!&#8221;).</p>
<p>However, my imagination is very limited and I&#8217;d like to hear more about what healthy habits Rails has made people learn and what bad habits to abandon. That&#8217;s why the topic of our January blogging contest is &#8220;Rails Revelations: How Rails made me a better programmer&#8221;. Heck, if Rails made you quit smoking, <a href="http://on-ruby.blogspot.com/2007/01/win-books-by-blogging.html">tell us about it</a>.</p></div>
