  <div class="entry-content"><p>As you might have read from yesterday&#8217;s <a href="http://jlaine.net/articles/2006/01/31/heads-up-for-passion">teaser</a>, I&#8217;ll start a series of articles about passion in web, business and life in general. Although Kathy Sierra&#8217;s blog <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/">Creating Passionate Users</a> has been a tremendous inspiration for the articles, they will not be restricted to just users. But for starters, we&#8217;ll take the easy route and just snatch two thirds of the name of Kathy&#8217;s blog.</p>
<p>The first question is, why would you want passionate customers? Isn&#8217;t it enough that your customers just wisely and cool-headedly choose what you&#8217;re offering?</p>
<p>Yes and no. There are a few reasons why you should love your passionate users like no one else.</p>
<h4>1. They will go to the end of the world just to get your products.</h4>
<p>The single best success story of having passionate users is, not surprisingly, <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a>. I can&#8217;t come up with any other company that would be so deeply loved by its customers. While most people hate (or even worse, couldn&#8217;t care less about) their computers, Appleists adore Macs. While that might seem like a strange kind of cult to outside, to Apple&#8212;especially before the iPod era&#8212;they&#8217;ve been worth their weight (and they&#8217;re mostly healthy, non-obese people) in gold.</p>
<p>In the late eighties, Apple was&#8212;nicely put&#8212;in deep shit. They had kicked Steve Jobs out, taken MBAs in to replace him, and in the process done some pretty brain-dead decisions. Sales where going a-tumblin&#8217; down and all that kept them going was the crowd of users that declined to use any other type of computer. It turned out the best way in the end, but I would be lying if I said it wasn&#8217;t a close call.</p>
<h4>2. They&#8217;re your best salesmen</h4>
<p>Even though the evangelistic attitude of Apple users annoy a lot of outsiders, it also turns many of them into customers. It&#8217;s hard not to think that there must be <em>something</em> inside that blind enthusiasm people show towards products of a single company.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve read the <a href="http://www.cluetrain.com/">Cluetrain Manifesto</a> (you have, don&#8217;t you), you know that in the place called <em>internet</em>, traditional marketing has little to no place to prosper. What matters multitudes more is human voice and conversation, and what could be more powerful and authentic source of that than thrilled, pleased customers. Heck, how do you think Jason Fried earned his Audi S4 with all but zero marketing budget?</p>
<h3>How to get them?</h3>
<p>There&#8217;s no single answer to this and honestly, I can only guess. There are a few obvious &#8220;tricks&#8221; like honesty, under-promising and over-delivering, being true to who you really are and keeping your human face even when you grow. However, it&#8217;s not nearly as simple. Apple has done quite a few things to piss of its customers. It&#8217;s sued rumor sites leaking information about Apple products, but the faithful have stayed. It&#8217;s released clearly unfinished products (the latest batch of 15&quot; PowerBooks, anyone?), and even that hasn&#8217;t been enough to wipe off the glow from its image.</p>
<p>So there just has to be <em>something</em> in you that makes your customers love you. What it is, you have to figure out by yourself. There&#8217;s no one-size-fits-all recipe. Obvious places to start are <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/">Creating Passionate Users</a> and 37signals&#8217; <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/">Signal vs. Noise</a>. The Signals have collected some heat lately, too, but better flamed than mediocre and forgotten.</p>
<p>Next week, 1-3-10 rule squared and a few other obsessed observations.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m a huge fan of Kathy Sierra&#8217;s <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/">Creating Passionate Users</a> blog, as well as passion in <em>everything</em>. As a tribute to <em>CPU_, I will tomorrow start a series of posts about passion in web and business. Until then, you&#8217;ll have to do with a quote from Kathy&#8217;s latest <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2006/01/death_by">article</a></em>riskav.html:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8230;if you&#8217;re not doing something that someone hates, it&#8217;s probably mediocre.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So true. Be hated. Be loved.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong><span class="caps">UPDATE</span> 2</strong> Grrreat news, just in time to welcome me from a nice training camp in Czech Republic: I hoped that Apple&#8217;s estimate would be as much off as with the iMac we bought a year ago and, lo and behold, today I got the most anticipated message in a long time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are pleased to send you this shipment notification regarding your order. Your order has been dispatched and will be delivered to your shipping address.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is almost a month sooner than their latest estimate, proving that also others than <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000565.html">those who opted for the 2.16GHz upgrade</a> can get their new darlings a lot sooner than expected. Come to daddy.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">UPDATE</span></strong> Both good and bad news. Good news first: The 1.83GHz Intel Core Duo chip has been automatically replaced by a 2.0GHz one in my order. Then the bad news: the estimated shipping date has been postponed to March 21.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How long will my order Take</strong><br />
Your order should ship on or before 07.03.2006<br />
Please allow a further 3-7 days from this date to deliver your order.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Buggers. Hope the estimate is as far off as usually.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m back home after giving three days of intensive Ruby and Rails training in UK. Comments are also back up. That&#8217;s mainly because this blog is now running <a href="http://typo.leetsoft.com">Typo</a> where comment spam handling is a lot easier than in textpattern.</p>
<p>Those of you who already were subscribed to my FeedBurner feed shouldn&#8217;t have any problems, but I&#8217;m still trying to figure out a way to make the old textpattern-style feed urls (e.g. &#8220;http://jlaine.net/?rss=1&#8221;) to redirect to FeedBurner. The problem is that they map to the index page which is cached in typo so it&#8217;s kind of hard to do the redirect in Ruby. I also haven&#8217;t found a working way in lighttpd to do redirects based on the query string. I guess it should be possible in apache running in front of lighty, but again haven&#8217;t yet figured out to do it through the webmin panel. If anyone knows how to do it in TxD, please drop me a note.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong><span class="caps">UPDATE</span></strong> I am a bit embarrassed to admit how easy I am to get persuaded, but comments from two crazy Danes (and that&#8217;s a compliment) made me change my mind. I already cancelled my PowerBook order but since it&#8217;s already shipped I&#8217;ll have to receive  and send it right back. I also ordered a NuPower battery for the <em>old faithful</em> to make me survive the five weeks until the MBP&#8217;s start shipping. Hope everything&#8217;s gonna go allright, but of course I&#8217;ll have the AppleCare to secure the purchase for a long time. Anyways, <a href="http://www.commonme.org/">Thomas</a> and <a href="http://www.commonme.org/">David</a>, I will now hold you partly responsible for the decision ;-)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PowerBook is dead! Long live the PowerBook!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2006/01/mwsf_predictions">Who</a>. <a href="http://www.kottke.org/06/01/letter-to-apple-support">Would</a>. Have. <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/">Thought</a>.</p>
<p>A surefire way to make Apple release a new model is to order a computer from them. Three and a half years ago in ZÃ¼rich I had just about unwrapped my then shiny new PowerBook when they announced performance upgrades.</p>
<p style="float:right;"><img src="http://images.apple.com/euro/macbookpro/includes/images/intel4xfaster20060109.png" title="4 times faster than PowerBook G4 1.67GHz" alt="4 times faster than PowerBook G4 1.67GHz" /></p>
<p>This time it&#8217;s a lot more dramatic and complicated, though. PowerBook no more. <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/">MacBook Pro</a> doesn&#8217;t sound as cool to me as the holy circle around PowerBook, but it&#8217;s quite hard to dismiss the performance gains even if they would be a bit overrated.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not quite in a situation like <a href="http://www.kottke.org/06/01/letter-to-apple-support">Jason</a> this time. My 17&quot; PowerBook has not yet arrived, and I can according to the law return it no questions asked inside two weeks after the arrival. But does it make this any  easier? Not really.</p>
<p>If I would have a working laptop at hand, I&#8217;d without a doubt cancel my order and place a new one for February. However, there&#8217;s a few things that make me wonder:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Like <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2006/01/mwsf_predictions">John Gruber</a> said in his this-time-not-quite-right predictions, the software firms just aren&#8217;t ready. The big ones maybe, but I haven&#8217;t upgraded to <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite/main.html">CS2</a> and I doubt CS1 will ever be available as a universal binary. Much less all the small apps I&#8217;ve grown just too dependent on.</li>
	<li>There have been a lot of small problems with version 1&#8217;s of every PowerBook during the last years. Given that the transition to Intel processors is maybe the biggest leap in the Apple history, I am a bit hesitant to pay for being their beta tester.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jarkko/74210887/" style="float:right;" ><img src="http://static.flickr.com/38/74210887_f7ea57217e_s.jpg" alt="Freiteg sleeve" /></a> I wanted, and will get, a 17&quot; PowerBook. Even if it&#8217;s slower, it&#8217;s got more screen estate. Besides, my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jarkko/74210887/">Freitag sleeve</a> is for a 17&quot; model.</li>
	<li>I need my new laptop yesterday. Not in February.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, all things considered, I&#8217;m going to keep the PowerBook. I&#8217;m going to give it a spin for a good six to twelve months and see if the new model is mature enough by then. Given the good resale value of the PowerBooks, I can handle that.</p>
<p>Still, I&#8217;m happy I placed the order before yesterday. Even though all the rational things speak for keeping the 17&quot; model, it might&#8217;ve been a bit too hard a decision to make after the announcement.</p></div>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8216;Tis the time of the year, so I&#8217;ll contribute my effort, too. These are my goals for 2006.</p>
<h4>1. Graduate</h4>
<p>The last 6.5 years of simultaneous studying, sports training and running a business have been great and giving, but there comes a time when you just got to cut the air. My thesis should be ready this spring so hopefully by the summer I will be carrying the propeller hat of an MSc.</p>
<p>Which leads to the next goal&#8230;</p>
<h4>2. Live off <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Rails</a></h4>
<p>In the ongoing winter the only reason I haven&#8217;t done full-time Ruby on Rails development has been my thesis. I love Rails. I love running my own business. Heck, I&#8217;m even writing a thesis about small businesses in open-source communities. I used to buy the &#8220;work a couple of years for someone else first&#8221; statement, but after being more than a year very close to the heart of the Rails movement and reading a lot about startups (most importantly, <a href="http://paulgraham.com/start.html">many</a> <a href="http://paulgraham.com/hiring.html">essays</a> by <a href="http://paulgraham.com">Paul Graham</a>.), I believe I will learn more by doing it myself. Besides, running free is currently the only way to work on Rails in Finland.</p>
<h4>3. Be fit</h4>
<p>This is a goal very close to my heart after being without running for a month because of <a href="http://www.time-to-run.com/injuries/thebig5/itb.htm" title="Iliotibial Band Syndrome"><span class="caps">ITB</span></a>. I changed my orienteering club for the next season and my training motivation has been very high, so getting rid of the injury is on the top of my wish list. If the recovery goes ok, I&#8217;m awaiting some <a href="http://www.jukola2006.net/index.php?lang=en">very fine</a> <a href="http://www.10mila.se/2006/index.asp?page=&amp;avd=1&amp;lang=1">moments</a> during the next summer.</p>
<h4>4. Get things done</h4>
<p>I&#8217;m looking for less things, not more. Less but better things. Things done better, to satisfy the <a href="http://www.baylor.edu/strengths/index.php?id=25460#%20q26">maximizer</a> in me. Finish the <a href="http://amazon.com/o/ASIN/0142000280/ref=nosim/jlainenet-20"><span class="caps">GTD</span></a>. Make my business more than a hobby. Reaching goal #1 is a major part in making this happen.</p>
<h4>5. Have fun</h4>
<p>This is a corollary from all of the goals above. Doing what I love and know best (sports and web/Rails development) must mean even more fun than before. If you say &#8220;Unprofessional&#8221;, I say &#8220;Bullocks&#8221;. I&#8217;m holding strongly of the opinion that happy people do the job better. #1 goal of my <a href="http://odesign.fi">consultancy</a> is to always have fun, whatever I do. Being happy and having fun also means that I will be a nicer person towards others.</p>
<p>So, that&#8217;s pretty much it. I probably forgot something greater than life, but bear with me.</p>
<p>Oh, and one more thing:</p>
<h4>The great bonus goal of 2006: Buy a new car</h4>
<p>I hope reaching the other goals will allow this, because my &#8217;88 Ford Escort might not stand another winter anymore. I was recently left with a broken handle in my hand after trying to open the left back door, and a <a href="http://www.softwareandstuff.com/h-tol_2n1jumpr.html">jumpstart pack</a> is a constant visitor under the hood, so some kind of update is more than due.</p></div>
