  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong><span class="caps">UPDATE</span> 2</strong> Grrreat news, just in time to welcome me from a nice training camp in Czech Republic: I hoped that Apple&#8217;s estimate would be as much off as with the iMac we bought a year ago and, lo and behold, today I got the most anticipated message in a long time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are pleased to send you this shipment notification regarding your order. Your order has been dispatched and will be delivered to your shipping address.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is almost a month sooner than their latest estimate, proving that also others than <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000565.html">those who opted for the 2.16GHz upgrade</a> can get their new darlings a lot sooner than expected. Come to daddy.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">UPDATE</span></strong> Both good and bad news. Good news first: The 1.83GHz Intel Core Duo chip has been automatically replaced by a 2.0GHz one in my order. Then the bad news: the estimated shipping date has been postponed to March 21.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How long will my order Take</strong><br />
Your order should ship on or before 07.03.2006<br />
Please allow a further 3-7 days from this date to deliver your order.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Buggers. Hope the estimate is as far off as usually.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m back home after giving three days of intensive Ruby and Rails training in UK. Comments are also back up. That&#8217;s mainly because this blog is now running <a href="http://typo.leetsoft.com">Typo</a> where comment spam handling is a lot easier than in textpattern.</p>
<p>Those of you who already were subscribed to my FeedBurner feed shouldn&#8217;t have any problems, but I&#8217;m still trying to figure out a way to make the old textpattern-style feed urls (e.g. &#8220;http://jlaine.net/?rss=1&#8221;) to redirect to FeedBurner. The problem is that they map to the index page which is cached in typo so it&#8217;s kind of hard to do the redirect in Ruby. I also haven&#8217;t found a working way in lighttpd to do redirects based on the query string. I guess it should be possible in apache running in front of lighty, but again haven&#8217;t yet figured out to do it through the webmin panel. If anyone knows how to do it in TxD, please drop me a note.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong><span class="caps">UPDATE</span></strong> I am a bit embarrassed to admit how easy I am to get persuaded, but comments from two crazy Danes (and that&#8217;s a compliment) made me change my mind. I already cancelled my PowerBook order but since it&#8217;s already shipped I&#8217;ll have to receive  and send it right back. I also ordered a NuPower battery for the <em>old faithful</em> to make me survive the five weeks until the MBP&#8217;s start shipping. Hope everything&#8217;s gonna go allright, but of course I&#8217;ll have the AppleCare to secure the purchase for a long time. Anyways, <a href="http://www.commonme.org/">Thomas</a> and <a href="http://www.commonme.org/">David</a>, I will now hold you partly responsible for the decision ;-)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PowerBook is dead! Long live the PowerBook!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2006/01/mwsf_predictions">Who</a>. <a href="http://www.kottke.org/06/01/letter-to-apple-support">Would</a>. Have. <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/">Thought</a>.</p>
<p>A surefire way to make Apple release a new model is to order a computer from them. Three and a half years ago in ZÃ¼rich I had just about unwrapped my then shiny new PowerBook when they announced performance upgrades.</p>
<p style="float:right;"><img src="http://images.apple.com/euro/macbookpro/includes/images/intel4xfaster20060109.png" title="4 times faster than PowerBook G4 1.67GHz" alt="4 times faster than PowerBook G4 1.67GHz" /></p>
<p>This time it&#8217;s a lot more dramatic and complicated, though. PowerBook no more. <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/">MacBook Pro</a> doesn&#8217;t sound as cool to me as the holy circle around PowerBook, but it&#8217;s quite hard to dismiss the performance gains even if they would be a bit overrated.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not quite in a situation like <a href="http://www.kottke.org/06/01/letter-to-apple-support">Jason</a> this time. My 17&quot; PowerBook has not yet arrived, and I can according to the law return it no questions asked inside two weeks after the arrival. But does it make this any  easier? Not really.</p>
<p>If I would have a working laptop at hand, I&#8217;d without a doubt cancel my order and place a new one for February. However, there&#8217;s a few things that make me wonder:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Like <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2006/01/mwsf_predictions">John Gruber</a> said in his this-time-not-quite-right predictions, the software firms just aren&#8217;t ready. The big ones maybe, but I haven&#8217;t upgraded to <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite/main.html">CS2</a> and I doubt CS1 will ever be available as a universal binary. Much less all the small apps I&#8217;ve grown just too dependent on.</li>
	<li>There have been a lot of small problems with version 1&#8217;s of every PowerBook during the last years. Given that the transition to Intel processors is maybe the biggest leap in the Apple history, I am a bit hesitant to pay for being their beta tester.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jarkko/74210887/" style="float:right;" ><img src="http://static.flickr.com/38/74210887_f7ea57217e_s.jpg" alt="Freiteg sleeve" /></a> I wanted, and will get, a 17&quot; PowerBook. Even if it&#8217;s slower, it&#8217;s got more screen estate. Besides, my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jarkko/74210887/">Freitag sleeve</a> is for a 17&quot; model.</li>
	<li>I need my new laptop yesterday. Not in February.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, all things considered, I&#8217;m going to keep the PowerBook. I&#8217;m going to give it a spin for a good six to twelve months and see if the new model is mature enough by then. Given the good resale value of the PowerBooks, I can handle that.</p>
<p>Still, I&#8217;m happy I placed the order before yesterday. Even though all the rational things speak for keeping the 17&quot; model, it might&#8217;ve been a bit too hard a decision to make after the announcement.</p></div>

<time datetime="2006-01-03T00:00:00+02:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jan 3<span>rd</span>, 2006</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8216;Tis the time of the year, so I&#8217;ll contribute my effort, too. These are my goals for 2006.</p>
<h4>1. Graduate</h4>
<p>The last 6.5 years of simultaneous studying, sports training and running a business have been great and giving, but there comes a time when you just got to cut the air. My thesis should be ready this spring so hopefully by the summer I will be carrying the propeller hat of an MSc.</p>
<p>Which leads to the next goal&#8230;</p>
<h4>2. Live off <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Rails</a></h4>
<p>In the ongoing winter the only reason I haven&#8217;t done full-time Ruby on Rails development has been my thesis. I love Rails. I love running my own business. Heck, I&#8217;m even writing a thesis about small businesses in open-source communities. I used to buy the &#8220;work a couple of years for someone else first&#8221; statement, but after being more than a year very close to the heart of the Rails movement and reading a lot about startups (most importantly, <a href="http://paulgraham.com/start.html">many</a> <a href="http://paulgraham.com/hiring.html">essays</a> by <a href="http://paulgraham.com">Paul Graham</a>.), I believe I will learn more by doing it myself. Besides, running free is currently the only way to work on Rails in Finland.</p>
<h4>3. Be fit</h4>
<p>This is a goal very close to my heart after being without running for a month because of <a href="http://www.time-to-run.com/injuries/thebig5/itb.htm" title="Iliotibial Band Syndrome"><span class="caps">ITB</span></a>. I changed my orienteering club for the next season and my training motivation has been very high, so getting rid of the injury is on the top of my wish list. If the recovery goes ok, I&#8217;m awaiting some <a href="http://www.jukola2006.net/index.php?lang=en">very fine</a> <a href="http://www.10mila.se/2006/index.asp?page=&amp;avd=1&amp;lang=1">moments</a> during the next summer.</p>
<h4>4. Get things done</h4>
<p>I&#8217;m looking for less things, not more. Less but better things. Things done better, to satisfy the <a href="http://www.baylor.edu/strengths/index.php?id=25460#%20q26">maximizer</a> in me. Finish the <a href="http://amazon.com/o/ASIN/0142000280/ref=nosim/jlainenet-20"><span class="caps">GTD</span></a>. Make my business more than a hobby. Reaching goal #1 is a major part in making this happen.</p>
<h4>5. Have fun</h4>
<p>This is a corollary from all of the goals above. Doing what I love and know best (sports and web/Rails development) must mean even more fun than before. If you say &#8220;Unprofessional&#8221;, I say &#8220;Bullocks&#8221;. I&#8217;m holding strongly of the opinion that happy people do the job better. #1 goal of my <a href="http://odesign.fi">consultancy</a> is to always have fun, whatever I do. Being happy and having fun also means that I will be a nicer person towards others.</p>
<p>So, that&#8217;s pretty much it. I probably forgot something greater than life, but bear with me.</p>
<p>Oh, and one more thing:</p>
<h4>The great bonus goal of 2006: Buy a new car</h4>
<p>I hope reaching the other goals will allow this, because my &#8217;88 Ford Escort might not stand another winter anymore. I was recently left with a broken handle in my hand after trying to open the left back door, and a <a href="http://www.softwareandstuff.com/h-tol_2n1jumpr.html">jumpstart pack</a> is a constant visitor under the hood, so some kind of update is more than due.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8220;Do you know any Jason Frieds&#8221;, <a href="http://pinds.com/articles/2005/11/22/do-you-know-any-jason-frieds">asks</a> Lars Pind. Just one, unfortunately. Lars is looking for interaction designers. However, I&#8217;d like to extend the question a bit. Where have all the (good) web designers gone? I recently missed a project because the client couldn&#8217;t find a talented freelance web designer to work on the ui side of the application. The gig went instead to a larger corporation that could &#8220;take care&#8221; of the interface design, too.</p>
<p>Now my definition of a web designer is maybe quite strict. A graphics artist sending a Photoshop comp to a developer is not a web designer. A designer that slices her comp to 26 level nested tables in Dreamweaver is not a web designer. So who is?</p>
<p>A web designer who calls herself professional should both have and use all of the following skills:</p>
<h5>Top-notch graphics design</h5>
<p>Both good eye and knowledge of the principles of graphics design, especially typography is crucial for any designer, and web design is no exception. The skills also need to be put into production so the usual graphics programs like Photoshop should work as a natural extension of one&#8217;s arm.</p>
<h5>Standards-based (X)<span class="caps">HTML</span> and <span class="caps">CSS</span></h5>
<p>Many extremely talented designers fall short on this point, as seen in the recent  <a href="http://www.molly.com/2005/11/03/an-open-letter-to-disney-store-uk/">Disney Store UK debacle</a>. Web design is much more than meets the eye.</p>
<h5>Information architecture</h5>
<p>How should the site be structured, what about the search? In my opinion information architecture can not be separated from web design.</p>
<h5>Usability and accessibility</h5>
<p>Long neglected, often forgotten. The latter now often needs to be taken care of by the law, if nothing else rings a bell.</p>
<h5>Programming</h5>
<p>Pure static websites are slowly becoming history. Almost every designer needs to be able to work with some kind of template languages. Also, a web designer with no JavaScript skills whatsoever will soon be obsolete.</p>
<h5>Interaction design</h5>
<p>Whether Web 2.0 is here or not, web applications are becoming increasingly common, which calls for a lot more disciples of <a href="http://www.cooper.com/content/company/executives.asp">Alan Cooper</a>, just like Lars&#8217;s post implies.</p>
<h5>Writing</h5>
<p>No kidding. Just like in almost any other territory, writing skills are <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives2/hiring_tip.php">essential</a> for a web designer. <a href="http://www.cluetrain.com/book/markets.html">Markets are conversations.</a> <a href="http://www.cameronmoll.com/archives/000628.html">Good designers decorate, great designers communicate.</a> Even in written text.</p>
<h5>Entrepreneurship and project management</h5>
<p>Pure selfishness, I don&#8217;t want great talents to drown into corporate behemoths.</p>
<h5>Ability and will to learn new things constantly and fast</h5>
<p>In <a href="http://digital-web.com/articles/a_recipe_for_learning_web_design/">A Recipe for Learning Web Design</a>, <a href="http://www.7nights.com/asterisk/">D. Keith Robinson</a> tells how he&#8217;s worked with fresh university graduates whose skills have been out-of-date upon graduation. This is not something that applies only in web design, but it is characteristic of it. It is no coincidence that top web designers are very active in writing and reading blogs.</p>
<h4>The problem with education</h4>
<p>The problem with finding people with all these skills is that they are all self-taught and thus anything but abundant. The current offering in university class education is far from great.</p>
<p>Often enough, it&#8217;s not even clear who should teach web design. Art colleges teach design but many of the technical aspects go far beyond their scope. CompSci departments tend to think web design and development is not real software development and thus not worth much effort.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8220;Do you know any Jason Frieds&#8221;, <a href="http://pinds.com/articles/2005/11/22/do-you-know-any-jason-frieds">asks</a> Lars Pind. Just one, unfortunately. Lars is looking for interaction designers. However, I&#8217;d like to extend the question a bit. Where have all the (good) web designers gone? I recently missed a project because the client couldn&#8217;t find a talented freelance web designer to work on the ui side of the application. The gig went instead to a larger corporation that could &#8220;take care&#8221; of the interface design, too.</p>
<p>Now my definition of a web designer is maybe quite strict. A graphics artist sending a Photoshop comp to a developer is not a web designer. A designer that slices her comp to 26 level nested tables in Dreamweaver is not a web designer. So who is?</p>
<p>A web designer who calls herself professional should both have and use all of the following skills:</p>
<p>Top-notch graphics design<br />
Both good eye and knowledge of the principles of graphics design, especially typography is crucial for any designer, and web design is no exception. The skills also need to be put into production so the usual graphics programs like Photoshop should work as a natural extension of one&#8217;s arm.</p>
<p>Standards-based (X)<span class="caps">HTML</span> and <span class="caps">CSS</span><br />
Many extremely talented designers fall short on this point, as seen in the recent  <a href="http://www.molly.com/2005/11/03/an-open-letter-to-disney-store-uk/">Disney Store UK debacle</a>. Web design is much more than meets the eye.</p>
<p>Information architecture<br />
How should the site be structured, what about the search? In my opinion information architecture can not be separated from web design.</p>
<p>Usability and accessibility<br />
Long neglected, often forgotten. The latter now often needs to be taken care of by the law, if nothing else rings a bell.</p>
<p>Programming<br />
Pure static websites are slowly becoming history. Almost every designer needs to be able to work with some kind of template languages. Also, a web designer with no JavaScript skills whatsoever will soon be obsolete.</p>
<p>Interaction design<br />
Whether Web 2.0 is here or not, web applications are becoming increasingly common, which calls for a lot more disciples of <a href="http://www.cooper.com/content/company/executives.asp">Alan Cooper</a>, just like Lars&#8217;s post implies.</p>
<p>Writing<br />
No kidding. Just like in almost any other territory, writing skills are <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives2/hiring_tip.php">essential</a> for a web designer. <a href="http://www.cluetrain.com/book/markets.html">Markets are conversations.</a> <a href="http://www.cameronmoll.com/archives/000628.html">Good designers decorate, great designers communicate.</a> Even in written text.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurship and project management<br />
Pure selfishness, I don&#8217;t want great talents to drown into corporate behemoths.</p>
<p>Ability and will to learn new things constantly and fast<br />
In <a href="http://digital-web.com/articles/a_recipe_for_learning_web_design/">A Recipe for Learning Web Design</a>, <a href="http://www.7nights.com/asterisk/">D. Keith Robinson</a> tells how he&#8217;s worked with fresh university graduates whose skills have been out-of-date upon graduation.</p>
<p>The problem with education</p>
<p>The problem with finding people with all these skills is that they are all self-taught and thus anything but abundant. The current offering in university class education is far from great.</p>
<p>Often enough, it&#8217;s not even clear who should teach web design. Art colleges teach design but many of the technical aspects go far beyond their scope. CompSci departments tend to think web design and development is not real software development and thus not worth much effort.
