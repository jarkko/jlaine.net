  <div class="entry-content"><p>OK, it&#8217;s time for me to become an adult as well eventually and one obvious symptom of that is that I started to work on my Master&#8217;s thesis this Monday.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll try to be as open about the writing process as possible, partly because of the subject and partly because I hope I can get some feedback from you.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the preliminary setting for my thesis:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Research problem</strong>: Small software businesses as part of an open source community.</li>
	<li><strong>Research question</strong>: What does it give to (and on the other hand demand from) a small business owner to be a member of an open source community?</li>
	<li><strong>Point of view</strong>: Small software business owner<sup class="footnote" id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup></li>
	<li><strong>Subquestions</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>What can you win by contributing to an open source project/community?</li>
		<li>What specific requirements are involved?</li>
		<li>What are the potholes you should avoid?</li>
	</ul></li>
</ul>
<p class="footnote" id="fn1"><a href="#fnr1"><sup>1</sup></a> Small software business is determined by both size and act. I would say 1-10 is probably the range of people working for the firm. However, 1 hacker + 9 marketing people doesn&#8217;t necessarily qualify as a small business here. So let&#8217;s say being less than 10 people and acting small.</p>
<p>I have setup an Amazon.com <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/2YDA3270NW5VC">wishlist</a> for the books I think are relevant for the thesis. If you have read some of them or know some other books that you think would be spot-on, please leave a comment. The same goes for online articles, of course. I found this huge <a href="http://opensource.mit.edu/online_papers.php">list</a> of papers about Open Source and made already an initial screening on the papers. But finding the best and most relevant for my purpose is not easy so if you know about some great piece you think I should take a look at, please let me know.</p>
<p>The theoretical background for the thesis will be the network theories of the <a href="http://www.impgroup.org/" title="Industrial  Marketing and Purchasing Group"><span class="caps">IMP</span></a> school, of which I know nothing yet. However, the goal is more to give practical advice to business owners than to be very theoretical. Therefore the meat of the thesis will consist of advice collected through interviews. So if you feel like you would have experiences to share and a lot to say, contact me and we can make up a time for an interview.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yay! Since <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com">David</a> won&#8217;t make it to Monday&#8217;s <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/eurooscon/view/e_sess/7445">Ruby on Rails tutorial</a> in <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/eurooscon/">EuroOSCON</a> (17-20 October), I will step into his <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000489.html">nice shoes</a> and give the presentation. I&#8217;m both totally excited and nervous about the gig, but I&#8217;m sure the former will take over eventually.</p>
<p>That said, if you haven&#8217;t yet registered for the first-ever EuroOSCON, it&#8217;s about the time to do it now. But wait! Before you register, check out <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000498.html">this David&#8217;s article</a>. It might be worth hard cash for you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A few months ago there was <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000454.html">a</a> <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/google_web_accelerator_hey_not_so_fast_an_alert_for_web_app_designers.php">heated</a> <a href="http://jlaine.net/blog/56/google-web-accelerator-considered-harmful">discussion</a> going on about Google Web Accelerator prefetching links and at the same time wreaking havoc in web apps that used plain <span class="caps">GET</span> links to change the state of an application. A few <a href="http://david.backpackit.com/pub/37983">tricks</a> came up on how one could block <span class="caps">GWA</span> from accessing given pages, but in the end, using <span class="caps">GET</span> requests for operations such as deleting records in your app remained dangerous.</p>
<p>The traditional means to avoid the perils of <span class="caps">GWA</span> and friends are two-fold: either use only form buttons (and thus <span class="caps">POST</span> requests) to commit these mission-critical actions, or link to a confirmation page that does the same. Unfortunately, these solutions are less than optimal. Using dozens of forms in a web page (think &#8220;delete&#8221; links in a product listing) makes the code a bit messy and a plethora of delete buttons doesn&#8217;t make the page look very nice, either. The problem with a confirmation page is that it adds one more step to the process and thus <a href="http://sensible.com/buythebook.html">makes the user think</a> one more time. One part of the beauty of OS X compared to Windows is that it doesn&#8217;t try to intervene in every action I make. I like to adhere to the same standards so I want to leave confirmation pages for situations where I really, <em>really</em> think they are crucial.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re using <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">Ruby on Rails</a> to build your next killer web app, consider yourself lucky. In the following paragraphs, I&#8217;m going to teach you how to use the Ã¼bercool <a href="http://rails.rubyonrails.com/classes/ActionView/Helpers/JavaScriptHelper.html"><span class="caps">AJAX</span> helpers</a> in Rails to create action links that are both slick, accessible and about as safe as you can get in the wild wide web.</p>
<p>OK, let&#8217;s assume you have an app ready that uses the following <code>link_to</code> helper call to destroy an item from your collection of <a href="http://www.sock-monkey.com/sockmonkey.html">sock monkeys</a>:</p>
<macro:code lang="ruby">
<p>&lt;%= link_to &#8220;Delete&#8221;, :controller =&gt; &#8220;monkey&#8221;, <br />
                   :action =&gt; &#8220;delete&#8221;, :id =&gt; monkey.id %&gt;</p>
</macro:code>
<p>This would serve you well, that is, until your uncle Enoch finds an abandoned Google Web Accelerator from the trash bin and your beloved monkeys start evaporating in the thin air. So what&#8217;s to the rescue? <a href="http://rails.rubyonrails.com/classes/ActionView/Helpers/JavaScriptHelper.html#M000395"><code>link_to_remote</code></a>!</p>
<macro:code lang="ruby">
<p>&lt;%= link_to_remote &#8220;Delete&#8221;, <br />
  :url =&gt; {:controller =&gt; &#8220;monkey&#8221;, <br />
           :action =&gt; &#8220;delete&#8221;, <br />
           :id =&gt; monkey.id},<br />
  :update =&gt; &#8220;monkeys&#8221; %&gt;</p>
</macro:code>
<p>Now we&#8217;re talking! You&#8217;re from this day on using <span class="caps">AJAX</span> in your app. Your monkeys are now destroyed without a refresh of a page, and no <span class="caps">GET</span> request is ever made. And as your <code>delete</code> action renders the monkey list when called by <span class="caps">AJAX</span>, the list updates itself as if magically. As simple as that. But wait! Aunt Marge (your unpaid tester) yells something behind her AS/400. She can&#8217;t use your app, nothing happens in her <em>lynx</em> even though she tries to follow the link. Crap. No javascript.</p>
<p>Fortunately <code>link_to_remote</code> has a fallback system:</p>
<macro:code lang="ruby">
<p>&lt;%= link_to_remote &#8220;Delete&#8221;, <br />
  {:url =&gt; {:controller =&gt; &#8220;monkey&#8221;, <br />
           :action =&gt; &#8220;delete&#8221;, <br />
           :id =&gt; monkey.id},<br />
  :update =&gt; &quot;monkeys&quot;},<br />
  {:href =&gt; url_for(:controller =&gt; &#8220;monkey&#8221;,<br />
                    :action =&gt; &#8220;delete&#8221;,<br />
                    :id =&gt; monkey.id)} %&gt;</p>
</macro:code>
<p>Using the <em>href</em> parameter makes <code>link_to_remote</code> to include a (tada!) <em>href</em> attribute in the anchor tag it creates. You can use <code>url_for</code> to create the address for it just like in normal links.</p>
<p>Ok, time for a little retrospective. What does our little link widget really do? In normal case, when the user has a modern browser with javascript enabled, when clicked, it calls the delete action with an <a href="http://developer.apple.com/internet/webcontent/xmlhttpreq.html"><em>XMLHttpRequest</em></a>, and upon success updates the element with id &#8220;monkeys&#8221; in the current page. If javascript is disabled, the browser will follow the traditional href link to the delete page.</p>
<p>Note that both the <span class="caps">AJAX</span> url and the old-fashioned href point to the same action. This is intentional. It gives us the possibility to do pretty powerful things with a tiny little action. We&#8217;ll take a look at that action, <code>MonkeyController::delete</code>, next.</p>
<macro:code lang="ruby">
<p>def delete<br />
  if request.xhr?</p>
<ol>
	<li>&#8230; deletion code here &#8230;<br />
    render :partial =&gt; &#8220;monkey&#8221;, :collection =&gt; @monkeys<br />
  elsif request.post?</li>
	<li>&#8230; deletion code here &#8230;<br />
    redirect_to :action =&gt; &#8220;list&#8221;<br />
  else # we assume this is a get message<br />
    render :action =&gt; &#8220;delete_confirmation&#8221;<br />
  end<br />
end<br />
</macro:code></li>
</ol>
<p>The <code>delete</code> function above handles three kinds of requests. If it&#8217;s called by <span class="caps">AJAX</span> (remember the normal case above?), it deletes the monkey and renders the list of remaining monkeys that will then be displayed in the calling page. If the action is called by a <span class="caps">POST</span> request (we&#8217;ll get into when this happens in just a few seconds), the monkey is also deleted but this time, the browser is redirected to the original monkey list page with an external redirect. In third case, when this action is called by a <span class="caps">GET</span> request, we show the user a confirmation page by rendering them delete_confirmation.rhtml (only the important parts of the template are shown here):</p>
<macro:code lang="ruby">
<p>&lt;%= form_tag :controller =&gt; &#8220;monkey&#8221;,<br />
             :action =&gt; &#8220;delete&#8221; <span>&gt;<br />
&lt;</span>= hidden_field_tag &#8220;id&#8221;, @params[:id] <span>&gt;<br />
&lt;</span>= submit_tag &#8220;Really, please get rid of the monkey&#8221; <span>&gt;<br />
&lt;</span>= end_form_tag %&gt;</p>
</macro:code>
<p>This is the page shown to old-world users with javascript disabled that clicked on the delete link on the monkey list page, resulting in calling the <code>delete</code> action with a <span class="caps">GET</span> request. This page is effectively, as you can see, a form that points to the same old <code>delete</code> method. We need to pass the monkey id in the form and we use the convenient hidden_field_tag helper method for that. Requests from this form page constitute the second case of calling <code>delete</code>, making request.post? return true (because <span class="caps">POST</span> is the default method for form_tag).</p>
<h3>Why is this method cool?</h3>
<p>You can use what kind of text or image links on your pages you ever want to, just like with normal links. That&#8217;s got to be nicer than a battery of submit buttons that look all different in different browsers. Even cooler, you don&#8217;t have to stuff your users through the tunnel of indifferent confirmation pages. Just one click, and away they go!</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not all, folks! The approach is also accesible. People with text browsers or screen readers (or the paranoid with javascript disabled) will be presented a traditional link followed by (sigh!) a confirmation page, for their own safety.</p>
<h3>Why is this method safe?</h3>
<p>No critical action is made with a <span class="caps">GET</span> request. In the most common case the deletion is made through an XMLHttpRequest, which is a) using <span class="caps">POST</span> method and b) launched by javascript so robots or Accelerators or other villains couldn&#8217;t even invoke it. The fallback method, on the other hand, uses the traditional confirmation page idea, forcing the user to submit a <span class="caps">POST</span> form before the actual deletion is made.</p>
<p>So, here&#8217;ya go! A complete system for deleting monkeys. Well, maybe not complete but you get the idea. And all with just a single controller method. And like with all <span class="caps">AJAX</span> helpers in Rails, it&#8217;s really easy to turn a traditional, link- or form-based approach to full-blown <span class="caps">AJAX</span> goodness in a matter of minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> The point of this article is not to teach all the goodies of link_to_remote or other <span class="caps">AJAX</span> helpers in Rails. There&#8217;s a lot <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/media/video/rails-ajax.mov" title="AJAX on Rails video">better</a> <a href="http://mir.aculo.us/">resources</a> for that and I intentionally left the code barebones simple. You&#8217;d certainly want to give the user some kind of indication that an <span class="caps">AJAX</span> process is underway, for example. Search the Rails <a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/">wiki</a> and <a href="http://rails.rubyonrails.com/"><span class="caps">API</span> docs</a> for more info.</p></div>

<p>What&#8217;s interesting is that every fifth Mac user in the <span class="caps">USA</span> has detected a virus even though there is not a single Mac virus out in the wild at the moment.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the major arguments of software patent proponents has been that the patents would only be a defensive shield for their owners. The latest <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/07/18/amazon_patent_suit/">patent war</a> between Amazon.com and Cendant shows <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/1999/10/25/amazon_sues_barnes_noble_over/">again</a> how much the claim holds true (from <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk">El Reg</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In his defense, Bezos argues that patents are defensive and should never be used, and illustrated this when Amazon.com <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2002/03/08/amazon_settles_1click_patent_dispute/">sued</a> rival bookseller Barnes and Noble for infringing on its notorious One Click patent.<br />
In fact Bezos hates patents so much he has applied for 15 in his own name of which eight have been granted; as patent-watcher TheoDP noticed recently, one Amazon patent was granted <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/07/13/232259">after five rejections</a> over four years. And as patent &#8217;399 shows, he was busy filing before Amazon.com had sold a single book.<br />
Clearly, the world needs more crusaders against patent abuse like Jeff Bezos.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After recent <a href="http://talkleft.com/new_archives/009971.html">events</a> <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com">Aaron Schwartz</a> <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/newethics">declares</a> he&#8217;s no more writing a blog but an online magazine. In accordance, he writes up his new regime with ten theses. The first rule: &#8220;??&#8221;Like all major newspapers&quot;:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact_checker, there will be no factchecking.??&quot; Read the whole <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/newethics">hilarious article</a>.</p>
<p>That said, I just got a notice about a bag full of books waiting for me in the local post office. Won&#8217;t complain. I can&#8217;t right now think of a better thing to do than to retreat to the summer cottage to peruse <a href="http://www.mcdonough.com/cradle_to_cradle.htm">Cradle to Cradle</a> and <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/BestSoftwareWriting.html">The Best Software Writing I</a> (containing pieces by, among others, Aaron, <a href="http://whytheluckystiff.net/">why the lucky stiff</a>, <a href="http://shirky.com/">Clay Shirky</a>,  <a href="http://boingboing.net">Cory Doctorow</a>, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">John Gruber</a> and <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com">Paul Graham</a>).</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you want to build a successful business, you need to get your customers to trust you.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a fairly new recovery drink (for sportsmen, but you knew that), Bioremix, in the Finnish market. It&#8217;s made in Finland, they are sponsoring the Finnish national orienteering team and seem to have some scientific research backing up the effects of the drink. But I&#8217;m completely turned off every time I read &#8220;Fresh lemon taste&#8221; in the package. Fresh? Lemon? If I had to describe the taste with one word it would be &#8216;puke&#8217;.</p>
<p>My empirical, absolutely non-scientific, research tells that the people who&#8217;ve tasted the drink can be split in two categories: those who&#8217;ll never touch it again and those who <em>can</em> drink it but with a grimace. I&#8217;ve yet to meet anyone who&#8217;d like the taste.</p>
<p>If the manufacturer tells me lies that I can instantly detect, how can I trust their claims about the &#8216;scientifically proven&#8217; effects. They might or might not be substantial but I will <em>always</em> be very doubtful about them. You might want consider that when fabricating more things in your packaging and marketing materials.</p></div>

<p>Recruiting has to be done at the Bill and Steve level, not at the Gretchen level. No matter how good a recruiter you are, you can&#8217;t compensate for working at a company that people don&#8217;t want to work for; you can&#8217;t compensate for being the target of eight years of fear and loathing from the slashdot community, which very closely overlaps the people you&#8217;re trying to recruit, and you can&#8217;t compensate for the fact that a company with a market cap of $272 billion <a href="http://blogs.apress.com/archives/000449.php?author=gary_cornell">just ain&#8217;t going to see their stock price go up</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When visiting <a href="http://pinds.com">Lars</a> last week I got a glimpse of a Mac Mini turned into a <acronym title="Personal Video Recorder"><span class="caps">PVR</span></acronym>. We haven&#8217;t had a working video recorder since 1999 and although (and because) we almost never have time to watch TV it&#8217;d be great to be able to timeshift the few truly interesting broadcasts. I already have a Mac Mini with all the bells and whistles lying in my shelf so all I needed is a TV tuner for it.</p>
<p>The best known tv boxes for Mac are made by <a href="http://www.elgato.com">Elgato</a>, a German company with close ties to Cupertino (they say). Their most popular model has been <a href="http://www.elgato.com/index.php?file=products_eyetv200">EyeTV 200</a>, which powers both <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com">David&#8217;s</a> and Lars&#8217;s living rooms.</p>
<p>Finland is already in the digital age, however, and about to pull the analog plug totally in 2007. Therefore EyeTV 200 would not be an ideal choice for my needs. Elgato is fortunately running in the front field even with digital PVR&#8217;s, providing a wide range of products for different <a href="http://www.dvb.org" title="Digital Video Broadcasting"><span class="caps">DVB</span></a> signals. We have cable-tv in our house so <a href="http://www.elgato.com/index.php?file=products_eyetv610">EyeTV 610</a> is the model I chose. It has an interface for a conax card reader and an updatable firmware so it shouldn&#8217;t become obsolete too soon. For those of you who know Finnish, here&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.macsanomat.com/nayta.php?id=2536">raving review</a> of the 610.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait for getting to play with the system after holidays. EyeTV uses a system called <a href="http://www.tvtv.co.uk">tvtv</a>, which is similar to <a href="http://www.tivo.com">TiVo&#8217;s</a> program guide and can be used to time recordings over the internet. The guide is already working in the biggest countries in Europe and should be available in Finland in late summer.</p>
<p>Ha! There&#8217;ll soon be one <a href="http://www.43things.com/things/view/19545">thing</a> less in my <a href="http://www.43things.com/">43things</a> <a href="http://www.43things.com/people/view/jarkko">list</a>.</p></div>
