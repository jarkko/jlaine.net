  <div class="entry-content"><p>Instead of getting back to my backlog of blog posts, let&#8217;s look ahead. After the Christmas of every orienteer, <a href="http://www.jukola2006.net/index.php?lang=en">Jukola relay</a>, I will jump to a plane and fly to Chicago for the first-ever <a href="http://railsconf.org">RailsConf</a>.</p>
<p><img src="http://nubyonrails.com/images/typo_graphs/countdown_railsconf.png" title="Countdown to RailsConf" alt="Countdown to RailsConf" /></p>
<p>(I snatched the countdown pic from <a href="http://nubyonrails.com/">Geoff</a>, go see his <a href="http://nubyonrails.com/articles/2006/06/11/countdown-to-railsconf">post about the graphic</a>)</p>
<p>I will travel together with <a href="http://reforge.fi/">Lauri Jutila</a> on Monday and we should be at O&#8217;Hare at around noon (<span class="caps">SAS</span> flight SK0945 from Stockholm). We&#8217;ll stay the first two nights in <a href="http://www.starwoodhotels.com/sheraton/search/hotel_detail.html?propertyID=91">Sheraton Suites Elk Grove Village</a> and move to the conference hotel on Wednesday.</p>
<p>I will stay in Chicago (alone) until Thursday June 29th. My plans are to crash to some B&amp;B or hostel near downtown Chicago after the conference ends and do touristing, running and (maybe) bike trips from there around the city. If you&#8217;re staying in Chicago for longer than just the conf, ping me and we can hook up.</p>
<p>I also contacted and got a very warm response from the <a href="http://www.chicago-orienteering.org/">Chicago Area Orienteering Club</a>. I&#8217;ll run a sprint-O event on Wednesday 21st, just before the conf, and they also promised me some maps where I can go training during my stay. I was even invited to a dinner by a local orienteer whose wife happens to be Finnish. Clark is renting out very nice <a href="http://www.aptschicago.com/">historic apartments around Chicago</a>, so if you&#8217;re looking for a place to stay there for longer periods, get in contact with him.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really excited about the whole trip. It&#8217;ll be my first visit to US and there are so many people I&#8217;ve known for a long time from the Rails community but whom I&#8217;ve never met in person. See you all in Chitown!</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When submitting forms in a web app, you often need to check whether a variable is set <em>and</em> not an empty string, because unfilled text input fields will be set but empty. In OpenACS there was a procedure called <code>exists_and_not_null</code> for this.</p>
<p>In Ruby you could do something like:</p>
<filter:code lang="ruby">
<p>if params[:string] and !params[:string].empty?</p>
</filter:code>
<p>However, that is both laborious and risky. If the variable happened to be something else than a string, calling <code>empty?</code> would bomb.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Rails defines a pretty much undocumented method <code>blank?</code>. <code>blank?</code> is defined in the <code>Object</code> class so every possible class in a Rails app will respond to it. By default, <code>blank?</code> returns true only for <code>nil</code>, <code>false</code>, an empty array or hash and &quot;&quot; (an empty string, after stripping the whitespace). Of course, you can overwrite the method in your own classes to make <code>blank?</code> behave as you please for them.</p>
<filter:code lang="ruby">
<p>&gt;&gt; 5.blank?<br />
=&gt; false<br />
&gt;&gt; o = Object.new<br />
=&gt; #<Object:0x10f8c6c><br />
&gt;&gt; o.blank?<br />
=&gt; false<br />
&gt;&gt; n = nil<br />
=&gt; nil<br />
&gt;&gt; n.blank?<br />
=&gt; true<br />
&gt;&gt; n = &quot;&quot;<br />
=&gt; &quot;&quot;<br />
&gt;&gt; n.blank?<br />
=&gt; true<br />
&gt;&gt; f = false<br />
=&gt; false<br />
&gt;&gt; f.blank?<br />
=&gt; true</p>
</filter:code>
<p>So using <code>blank?</code> you can replace the code above by</p>
<filter:code lang="ruby">
<p>unless params[:string].blank?</p>
</filter:code>
<p>and you&#8217;re good to go. Enjoy!</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>And from the ashes rises&#8230; No May 1st Reboot here, not even <del>redesigned</del> realigned outlook. But hopefully the June 9th Reboot made posting work again.</p>
<p>Talking about <a href="http://reboot.dk">Reboot</a>, it was again a great event. There were <a href="http://www.benhammersley.com/Ben/Me.html">some</a> <a href="http://www.docsearls.com/">great</a> speeches &#8211; maybe not quite as many as last year, though &#8211; but the biggest feat for me is the passionate and enthusiastic spirit of the conference and the endless discussions it fosters.</p>
<p>We had a very nice <a href="http://outside-thoughts.octopod.info/articles/2006/06/02/rails-at-reboot-8">Rails discussion</a> session where I (as promised) talked very little and let the participants take care of the talking. I met a great deal of nice people, <a href="http://pinds.com">from</a> <a href="http://marklunds.com/">old</a> <a href="http://sean.treadway.info/">friends</a> to <a href="http://blog.olle.ter.dk/">those</a> I&#8217;d only <a href="http://neubia.com/">met</a> <a href="http://not.invisible.ch/">online</a> to those I&#8217;d <a href="http://justaddwater.dk/">never</a> heard of before. We had lengthy discussions with a guy from the original Sun Java team (Hi Reno :) who was totally in love with Rails now and gathering a team for a startup. It really feels like it&#8217;s the summer of &#8217;99 again (with hopefully more than a few things learned).</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I was sitting in a workshop panel in an <a href="http://ossi.coss.fi/ossi/index.php?id=95">open source seminar</a> given by <a href="http://ossi.coss.fi/ossi/">my research group</a> this Tuesday. The idea behind the afternoon workshop was to collaboratively create a simple business plan for a company entering the &#8220;corporate wiki&#8221; market, competing with companies like <a href="http://www.socialtext.com/">SocialText</a>.</p>
<p>The end result was that it&#8217;s not critical in the end whether the system is built on open source or not. Using open source can give an edge but the stack is still just a tool. I agree with all this.</p>
<p>However, the final conclusion was that making the company succeed they should get a big client and build such hooks to the system that the client can never get out of the deal. That, people argued my resistance, was how all the successful software companies did it. To paraphrase Jason Fried, &#8220;F for give me a fucking break.&#8221; Granted, the conclusion was a kind of tongue-in-cheek one, but I just couldn&#8217;t help feeling like shoving <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/">Kathy Sierra</a> down their throats. Fortunately for everyone, including Kathy, she wasn&#8217;t present.</p>
<p>Sure, you can get by very well with this kind of strategy. Just look at Microsoft. But the world changes, my friend. When things get worse, you need people who love you, people who go to the end of the world to find your products. Remember Lotus, and its once infamous Notes mail and intranet system? It was once on <em>every</em> enterprise desktop. There wasn&#8217;t many options back then and Lotus did everything to create <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000032.html">customer lock-in</a> to the system. And they were successful. For a while.</p>
<p>But people hated Notes. I have with my own eyes seen &#8220;Notes sucks!&#8221; <a href="http://global.dymo.com/enUS/Home/default.html">Dymo</a> labels stuck on people&#8217;s monitors. So when the field evolved and companies started to have more options, some of which were very open in nature, they weren&#8217;t very fond of sticking with Notes anymore, even though the migration away from it was very painful. So Lotus tripped and ended up in the arms of <span class="caps">IBM</span>, and even though the Big Blue still tries to push Notes, I know of very few companies that are moving <em>towards</em> using it.</p>
<p>The lesson: Be nice and honest to customers, both current and prospective. People aren&#8217;t stupid, they can see true your plots. Buy <a href="https://gettingreal.37signals.com/">Getting Real</a> (featuring yours truly) <em>and</em> <a href="http://www.cluetrain.com/">The Cluetrain Manifesto</a> and take them to the heart.</p>
<p>And no, everyone else is not trying to fuck their customers. Asserting that is just like a cheating athlete assuring himself that everyone else is taking drugs, too. When you start justifying your ploys by lying to yourself, you&#8217;re in pretty deep shit. <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/nat/">Nat Torkington</a> has an <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/04/doc_searls_business_as_moralit.html">interesting discussion</a> with <a href="http://docsearls.com/">Doc Searls</a> about Business as Morality. There Doc depicts an image of Flickr as a company that understands how to succeed really long term: not by locking in customers but by <em>creating passionate users with excellent products and service</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>At eTech, I saw a preview of a browser-based Photoshop/Album organizing/print product front-end service. The biggest thing the creator wanted to show was how generous Flickr is. &#8220;Watch this,&#8221; he said, before using Flickr&#8217;s <span class="caps">API</span> to suck all 6000+ of my photos from Flickr into his product. All the metadata, all the tags and associations, were intact. His point: Flickr isn&#8217;t a silo. Their closed and proprietary stuff doesn&#8217;t extend, not is it used, to lock up customer or user data. It&#8217;s wide open. Free-range. Most of all, however, it is a &#8220;good citizen&#8221;. It is generous where it counts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>P.S. As it turns out, according to <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com">Paul Graham</a>, having few big clients might not be that good <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/start.html">a plan for a startup</a> anyway:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Start by writing software for smaller companies, because it&#8217;s easier to sell to them. It&#8217;s worth so much to sell stuff to big companies that the people selling them the crap they currently use spend a lot of time and money to do it. And while you can outhack Oracle with one frontal lobe tied behind your back, you can&#8217;t outsell an Oracle salesman. So if you want to win through better technology, aim at smaller customers.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m working for the first time on a project that uses the <a href="http://www.globalize-rails.org/wiki/">Globalize Rails plugin</a>. It rocks. It&#8217;s about as close to an unobtrusive <acronym title="internationalization"><span class="caps">I18N</span></acronym>/<acronym title="localization"><span class="caps">L10N</span></acronym> framework as it gets. I&#8217;ve used a couple of approaches before, both self-written and third party, but they don&#8217;t get even close to the ease of deployment with Globalize.</p>
<p>There is one gotcha with Globalize, though, which is probably worth sharing: it overwrites Rails code. This isn&#8217;t such a surprise since runtime extensibility is one of the founding Ruby principles. It does, however, break the backwards-compatibility.</p>
<p>One specific thing that bit me was that after starting to use Globalize, <em>assert_template</em> didn&#8217;t work anymore. Suddenly it started to get the whole path for the template, as opposed to relative from the template root which is the default Rails behaviour. So assertions like</p>
<filter:code lang="ruby">
<p>assert_template &#8220;admin/books/new&#8221;</p>
</filter:code>
<p>won&#8217;t work anymore. You <em>could</em> of course put the absolute path in your assertion but that would break the portability of the app. I guess it would work with constants like RAILS_ROOT, but using it in every assert_template call would be just plain ugly.</p>
<p>There is a pending <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/4235">patch in Rails Trac to accept regexps as assert_template arguments</a>, which would make the problem go away, but until it gets applied to the trunk, I&#8217;ll just comment out the assert_template calls.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a lot of sites where you have to select your time zone as part of the registration process. The zones are often displayed like this: &#8220;(GMT+02:00) Helsinki&#8221;. That sucks.</p>
<p>Given that the time zone lists always have dozens of items, it&#8217;s really annoying to scroll down to items further down the list. Fortunately, browser makers have been wise enough to implement keyboard navigation for drop-down lists. Therefore, when selecting a country, I can type &#8220;fin&#8221; and hit <em>enter</em>, and be quite sure Finland is selected.</p>
<p>With the time zone lists like above, I can&#8217;t use the keyboard. Or I could, but I would have to type everything until the &#8220;H&#8221; in &#8220;Helsinki&#8221; and that would pretty much cancel the benefits of using the keyboard. So if you need to implement time zone lists, do put the city name first and the time zone only after that. Sure, it&#8217;s a minor annoyance but they tend to add up.</p></div>

<p>The <em>big thing</em> for me in using labels is that they effectively make the clickable area of the form element a lot bigger. Which one would you prefer pushing? The male (without label) or the female (with label)?</p>
<form name="test" action="test">
<p><input type="radio" name="sex" id="male" /> <span class="caps">MALE</span><br/>
<input type="radio" name="sex" id="female" /> <label for="female"><span class="caps">FEMALE</span> (with label)</label><br/></p>
</form>
<p>(Of course if you use Safari you don&#8217;t care because Safari doesn&#8217;t support the label element.)</p>
<p>I think using real form labels is a huge usability enhancement in addition to helping accessibility.</p>
<p>For gawd&#8217;s sake, using the Rails&#8217; form helpers to construct the form automatically uses labels, so it shouldn&#8217;t be too hard for two of the more prominent Rails showcases to use it.</p></div>
