  <div class="entry-content"><p>One of the major arguments of software patent proponents has been that the patents would only be a defensive shield for their owners. The latest <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/07/18/amazon_patent_suit/">patent war</a> between Amazon.com and Cendant shows <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/1999/10/25/amazon_sues_barnes_noble_over/">again</a> how much the claim holds true (from <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk">El Reg</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In his defense, Bezos argues that patents are defensive and should never be used, and illustrated this when Amazon.com <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2002/03/08/amazon_settles_1click_patent_dispute/">sued</a> rival bookseller Barnes and Noble for infringing on its notorious One Click patent.<br />
In fact Bezos hates patents so much he has applied for 15 in his own name of which eight have been granted; as patent-watcher TheoDP noticed recently, one Amazon patent was granted <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/07/13/232259">after five rejections</a> over four years. And as patent &#8217;399 shows, he was busy filing before Amazon.com had sold a single book.<br />
Clearly, the world needs more crusaders against patent abuse like Jeff Bezos.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you want to build a successful business, you need to get your customers to trust you.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a fairly new recovery drink (for sportsmen, but you knew that), Bioremix, in the Finnish market. It&#8217;s made in Finland, they are sponsoring the Finnish national orienteering team and seem to have some scientific research backing up the effects of the drink. But I&#8217;m completely turned off every time I read &#8220;Fresh lemon taste&#8221; in the package. Fresh? Lemon? If I had to describe the taste with one word it would be &#8216;puke&#8217;.</p>
<p>My empirical, absolutely non-scientific, research tells that the people who&#8217;ve tasted the drink can be split in two categories: those who&#8217;ll never touch it again and those who <em>can</em> drink it but with a grimace. I&#8217;ve yet to meet anyone who&#8217;d like the taste.</p>
<p>If the manufacturer tells me lies that I can instantly detect, how can I trust their claims about the &#8216;scientifically proven&#8217; effects. They might or might not be substantial but I will <em>always</em> be very doubtful about them. You might want consider that when fabricating more things in your packaging and marketing materials.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When visiting <a href="http://pinds.com">Lars</a> last week I got a glimpse of a Mac Mini turned into a <acronym title="Personal Video Recorder"><span class="caps">PVR</span></acronym>. We haven&#8217;t had a working video recorder since 1999 and although (and because) we almost never have time to watch TV it&#8217;d be great to be able to timeshift the few truly interesting broadcasts. I already have a Mac Mini with all the bells and whistles lying in my shelf so all I needed is a TV tuner for it.</p>
<p>The best known tv boxes for Mac are made by <a href="http://www.elgato.com">Elgato</a>, a German company with close ties to Cupertino (they say). Their most popular model has been <a href="http://www.elgato.com/index.php?file=products_eyetv200">EyeTV 200</a>, which powers both <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com">David&#8217;s</a> and Lars&#8217;s living rooms.</p>
<p>Finland is already in the digital age, however, and about to pull the analog plug totally in 2007. Therefore EyeTV 200 would not be an ideal choice for my needs. Elgato is fortunately running in the front field even with digital PVR&#8217;s, providing a wide range of products for different <a href="http://www.dvb.org" title="Digital Video Broadcasting"><span class="caps">DVB</span></a> signals. We have cable-tv in our house so <a href="http://www.elgato.com/index.php?file=products_eyetv610">EyeTV 610</a> is the model I chose. It has an interface for a conax card reader and an updatable firmware so it shouldn&#8217;t become obsolete too soon. For those of you who know Finnish, here&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.macsanomat.com/nayta.php?id=2536">raving review</a> of the 610.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait for getting to play with the system after holidays. EyeTV uses a system called <a href="http://www.tvtv.co.uk">tvtv</a>, which is similar to <a href="http://www.tivo.com">TiVo&#8217;s</a> program guide and can be used to time recordings over the internet. The guide is already working in the biggest countries in Europe and should be available in Finland in late summer.</p>
<p>Ha! There&#8217;ll soon be one <a href="http://www.43things.com/things/view/19545">thing</a> less in my <a href="http://www.43things.com/">43things</a> <a href="http://www.43things.com/people/view/jarkko">list</a>.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is too funny: <a href="http://martinfowler.com/">Martin Fowler</a> just pointed to a <span class="caps">PDF</span> <a href="http://martinfowler.com/ieeeSoftware/accChange.pdf">article</a> about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">Agile Development</a> written by Dave Thomas. The article has a picture of the writer (Thomas) but to me it looked something totally else than the <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/contact.html">picture</a> of <a href="http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi">Dave Thomas</a> I&#8217;ve had in my head.</p>
<p>I wondered this in #rubyonrails irc channel and some bright lad noticed that the <a href="http://www.davethomas.net/">Dave Thomas</a> who&#8217;d written the article was not the same Dave Thomas we knew at all. In fact he is an Australian Computer Science professor.</p>
<p>This is a funny coincidence, even more because PragDave is one of the original signers of the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a> and the other Dave is the founding director of <a href="http://agilealliance.com/home">AgileAlliance.com</a>. Or at least that&#8217;s what the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/ieeeSoftware/accChange.pdf">article</a> says. Hope they haven&#8217;t mixed up the two, I certainly would.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Wednesday</h2>
<p>Had a nice (and expensive) dinner in Cafe Ketchup in Copenhagen Tivoli with lots of Danish bloggers and <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/">Scoble</a>. The night turned adventurous when I tried to get out of the already closed Tivoli. After banging the gates for a while with some locals a nice bartender let us out through the emergency exit of his bar. Now that&#8217;s a good idea for maximizing your daily income: close the area before the restaurants inside it shut down.</p>
<h2>Thursday</h2>
<p>Building of Basecamp day. The workshop turned out to be as great as rumoured. I can&#8217;t say I heard that much completely new stuff (ok, I&#8217;ve probably followed <a href="http://37signals.com">37signals</a>, <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com">Basecamp</a> and <a href="http://rubyonrails.com">Rails</a> a <em>bit</em> closer than average) but hearing all that in a single workshop, in such a coherent manner was probably worth the juicy price.</p>
<p>In the evening we joined the pre-reboot party at someone&#8217;s own (!) pub. Saw for the first time a lot of online friends and enjoyed the generous free beverages. The evening ended with a dinner in supposedly the oldest restaurant in Copenhagen, Lille Apoteket. Get one of the steaks if you ever stumble upon the place, at least the pepper steak was excellent.</p>
<h2>Friday</h2>
<h3>Keynotes</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.searls.com/">Doc Searls</a> was really great, you should definitely see him speaking some time. <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/">Scoble</a> was, well, a bit unorganized compared to Searls and I didn&#8217;t get much more out of his speech than that I should blog. OK, I will.</p>
<h3>Calacanis</h3>
<p>I have to admit, I wasn&#8217;t that familiar with <a href="http://calacanis.weblogsinc.com/">Jason Calacanis</a> before, but he turned out to be a great speaker, too, articulating the power of blogging a <strong>lot</strong> better than Scbole. Here&#8217;s his own <a href="http://calacanis.weblogsinc.com/entry/1234000243046277/">post</a> about the talk.</p>
<p>After Calacanis, David Axmark of <a href="http://www.mysql.com">MySQL</a> fame talked about how to make money with Open Source software. The topic was really up my alley, maybe a bit too much, since I didn&#8217;t find anything really new from his speech. Maybe his quite monotonic presentation had something to do with that, too.</p>
<p>The lunch was predated by a talk by <a href="http://www.ludicorp.com/team_member.php?id=7">Ben Cerveny</a>, an interface designer behind e.g. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> and Quake. The presentation on Game theory was a disappointment for me as I had waited quite a bit more. It all just went flying high past me, don&#8217;t really know why. Lars offers one <a href="http://www.pinds.com/blog/one-entry?entry%5fid=39969">explanation</a> with comments from Ben.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s always an illuminating event to find a name for a phenomenon you&#8217;ve known existed but didn&#8217;t really find a way to communicate it to others. One famous example of it is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX" title="Asynchronous JavaScript and XML"><span class="caps">AJAX</span></a>. It&#8217;s been around for years, got more exposure upon <a href="http://maps.google.com/">Google Maps</a>, but didn&#8217;t really hit the mainstream until <a href="http://www.jjg.net/">Jesse James Garrett</a> <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php">labeled</a> the technique <span class="caps">AJAX</span> and wrote an article about it.</p>
<p>I have an (annoying, some people say) habit to not only strive for but also buy the best. I don&#8217;t really understand people who when seeing me carrying a Powerbook come and wonder: &#8220;isn&#8217;t it terribly expensive?&#8221; Well, yeah, if you compare it to a €799 wholesale store laptop. But come on, it&#8217;s my workplace, a hobby and a communication vehicle in one. Why should I settle for anything short of the best?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pinds.com/blog/">Lars Pind</a>, my kind host here in Copenhagen, recently posted an <a href="http://www.pinds.com/blog/one-entry?entry%5fid=39915">entry</a> that really resonated with me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you&#8217;re a <a href="http://www.baylor.edu/stren€dex.php?id=25460#%20q26">maximizer</a>, second best is not good enough. Good enough isn&#8217;t good enough.<br />
It&#8217;s not a materialistic thing at all. And it&#8217;s not snobbish. It&#8217;s a question of aesthetics and value. Why waste this precious life surrounding us with anything less? It&#8217;s greatly motivating and uplifting to surround yourself with the best there is, and help make it even better.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s me. A <a href="http://www.baylor.edu/strengths/index.php?id=25460#%20q26">maximizer</a>. It&#8217;s heartening to find out I&#8217;m not that freaky after all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me, I find that same kind of satisfaction in a really well thought out business model, in well performed music, in a slick software user interface, in a superbly written article about Ketchup in the New Yorker, in a perfect piece of Parmigiano, a well-executed business move, in an outstanding show by Eddie Izzard, in a beautiful piece of clothing, in a uber-functional perambulator, or in the Californian coast line (yeah, this isn&#8217;t man-made like the others, but whoever did it did a pretty impressive job. Kudos!)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Amen. Thank you, Lars, for (among many other things) helping me to take another step towards finding out who I really am.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When walking back to Lars&#8217; place Thursday evening, I spotted Holger Danskes vej, which reminded me of, well, Holger Dansk, but more importantly, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0932633439/">Peopleware</a>. Peopleware is an amazing book about making software projects work. The meat of the book is that most projects don&#8217;t fail because of technological reasons but sociological: unhappy people. Joel Spolsky hits the nail pretty well by calling Peopleware an &#8220;anti-Dilbert manifesto&#8221;.</p>
<p>I know. I&#8217;ve written about Peopleware before. But hey, I&#8217;ve read the book many times and still find it as eye-opening as ever. So if you&#8217;ve so far been able to find excuses for avoiding the purchase, give up. You won&#8217;t regret it.</p></div>
