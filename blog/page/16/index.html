  <div class="entry-content"><p>When visiting <a href="http://pinds.com">Lars</a> last week I got a glimpse of a Mac Mini turned into a <acronym title="Personal Video Recorder"><span class="caps">PVR</span></acronym>. We haven&#8217;t had a working video recorder since 1999 and although (and because) we almost never have time to watch TV it&#8217;d be great to be able to timeshift the few truly interesting broadcasts. I already have a Mac Mini with all the bells and whistles lying in my shelf so all I needed is a TV tuner for it.</p>
<p>The best known tv boxes for Mac are made by <a href="http://www.elgato.com">Elgato</a>, a German company with close ties to Cupertino (they say). Their most popular model has been <a href="http://www.elgato.com/index.php?file=products_eyetv200">EyeTV 200</a>, which powers both <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com">David&#8217;s</a> and Lars&#8217;s living rooms.</p>
<p>Finland is already in the digital age, however, and about to pull the analog plug totally in 2007. Therefore EyeTV 200 would not be an ideal choice for my needs. Elgato is fortunately running in the front field even with digital PVR&#8217;s, providing a wide range of products for different <a href="http://www.dvb.org" title="Digital Video Broadcasting"><span class="caps">DVB</span></a> signals. We have cable-tv in our house so <a href="http://www.elgato.com/index.php?file=products_eyetv610">EyeTV 610</a> is the model I chose. It has an interface for a conax card reader and an updatable firmware so it shouldn&#8217;t become obsolete too soon. For those of you who know Finnish, here&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.macsanomat.com/nayta.php?id=2536">raving review</a> of the 610.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait for getting to play with the system after holidays. EyeTV uses a system called <a href="http://www.tvtv.co.uk">tvtv</a>, which is similar to <a href="http://www.tivo.com">TiVo&#8217;s</a> program guide and can be used to time recordings over the internet. The guide is already working in the biggest countries in Europe and should be available in Finland in late summer.</p>
<p>Ha! There&#8217;ll soon be one <a href="http://www.43things.com/things/view/19545">thing</a> less in my <a href="http://www.43things.com/">43things</a> <a href="http://www.43things.com/people/view/jarkko">list</a>.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is too funny: <a href="http://martinfowler.com/">Martin Fowler</a> just pointed to a <span class="caps">PDF</span> <a href="http://martinfowler.com/ieeeSoftware/accChange.pdf">article</a> about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development">Agile Development</a> written by Dave Thomas. The article has a picture of the writer (Thomas) but to me it looked something totally else than the <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/contact.html">picture</a> of <a href="http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi">Dave Thomas</a> I&#8217;ve had in my head.</p>
<p>I wondered this in #rubyonrails irc channel and some bright lad noticed that the <a href="http://www.davethomas.net/">Dave Thomas</a> who&#8217;d written the article was not the same Dave Thomas we knew at all. In fact he is an Australian Computer Science professor.</p>
<p>This is a funny coincidence, even more because PragDave is one of the original signers of the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org/">Agile Manifesto</a> and the other Dave is the founding director of <a href="http://agilealliance.com/home">AgileAlliance.com</a>. Or at least that&#8217;s what the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/ieeeSoftware/accChange.pdf">article</a> says. Hope they haven&#8217;t mixed up the two, I certainly would.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Wednesday</h2>
<p>Had a nice (and expensive) dinner in Cafe Ketchup in Copenhagen Tivoli with lots of Danish bloggers and <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/">Scoble</a>. The night turned adventurous when I tried to get out of the already closed Tivoli. After banging the gates for a while with some locals a nice bartender let us out through the emergency exit of his bar. Now that&#8217;s a good idea for maximizing your daily income: close the area before the restaurants inside it shut down.</p>
<h2>Thursday</h2>
<p>Building of Basecamp day. The workshop turned out to be as great as rumoured. I can&#8217;t say I heard that much completely new stuff (ok, I&#8217;ve probably followed <a href="http://37signals.com">37signals</a>, <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com">Basecamp</a> and <a href="http://rubyonrails.com">Rails</a> a <em>bit</em> closer than average) but hearing all that in a single workshop, in such a coherent manner was probably worth the juicy price.</p>
<p>In the evening we joined the pre-reboot party at someone&#8217;s own (!) pub. Saw for the first time a lot of online friends and enjoyed the generous free beverages. The evening ended with a dinner in supposedly the oldest restaurant in Copenhagen, Lille Apoteket. Get one of the steaks if you ever stumble upon the place, at least the pepper steak was excellent.</p>
<h2>Friday</h2>
<h3>Keynotes</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.searls.com/">Doc Searls</a> was really great, you should definitely see him speaking some time. <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/">Scoble</a> was, well, a bit unorganized compared to Searls and I didn&#8217;t get much more out of his speech than that I should blog. OK, I will.</p>
<h3>Calacanis</h3>
<p>I have to admit, I wasn&#8217;t that familiar with <a href="http://calacanis.weblogsinc.com/">Jason Calacanis</a> before, but he turned out to be a great speaker, too, articulating the power of blogging a <strong>lot</strong> better than Scbole. Here&#8217;s his own <a href="http://calacanis.weblogsinc.com/entry/1234000243046277/">post</a> about the talk.</p>
<p>After Calacanis, David Axmark of <a href="http://www.mysql.com">MySQL</a> fame talked about how to make money with Open Source software. The topic was really up my alley, maybe a bit too much, since I didn&#8217;t find anything really new from his speech. Maybe his quite monotonic presentation had something to do with that, too.</p>
<p>The lunch was predated by a talk by <a href="http://www.ludicorp.com/team_member.php?id=7">Ben Cerveny</a>, an interface designer behind e.g. <a href="http://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> and Quake. The presentation on Game theory was a disappointment for me as I had waited quite a bit more. It all just went flying high past me, don&#8217;t really know why. Lars offers one <a href="http://www.pinds.com/blog/one-entry?entry%5fid=39969">explanation</a> with comments from Ben.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s always an illuminating event to find a name for a phenomenon you&#8217;ve known existed but didn&#8217;t really find a way to communicate it to others. One famous example of it is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX" title="Asynchronous JavaScript and XML"><span class="caps">AJAX</span></a>. It&#8217;s been around for years, got more exposure upon <a href="http://maps.google.com/">Google Maps</a>, but didn&#8217;t really hit the mainstream until <a href="http://www.jjg.net/">Jesse James Garrett</a> <a href="http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php">labeled</a> the technique <span class="caps">AJAX</span> and wrote an article about it.</p>
<p>I have an (annoying, some people say) habit to not only strive for but also buy the best. I don&#8217;t really understand people who when seeing me carrying a Powerbook come and wonder: &#8220;isn&#8217;t it terribly expensive?&#8221; Well, yeah, if you compare it to a €799 wholesale store laptop. But come on, it&#8217;s my workplace, a hobby and a communication vehicle in one. Why should I settle for anything short of the best?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pinds.com/blog/">Lars Pind</a>, my kind host here in Copenhagen, recently posted an <a href="http://www.pinds.com/blog/one-entry?entry%5fid=39915">entry</a> that really resonated with me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you&#8217;re a <a href="http://www.baylor.edu/stren€dex.php?id=25460#%20q26">maximizer</a>, second best is not good enough. Good enough isn&#8217;t good enough.<br />
It&#8217;s not a materialistic thing at all. And it&#8217;s not snobbish. It&#8217;s a question of aesthetics and value. Why waste this precious life surrounding us with anything less? It&#8217;s greatly motivating and uplifting to surround yourself with the best there is, and help make it even better.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s me. A <a href="http://www.baylor.edu/strengths/index.php?id=25460#%20q26">maximizer</a>. It&#8217;s heartening to find out I&#8217;m not that freaky after all.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Me, I find that same kind of satisfaction in a really well thought out business model, in well performed music, in a slick software user interface, in a superbly written article about Ketchup in the New Yorker, in a perfect piece of Parmigiano, a well-executed business move, in an outstanding show by Eddie Izzard, in a beautiful piece of clothing, in a uber-functional perambulator, or in the Californian coast line (yeah, this isn&#8217;t man-made like the others, but whoever did it did a pretty impressive job. Kudos!)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Amen. Thank you, Lars, for (among many other things) helping me to take another step towards finding out who I really am.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When walking back to Lars&#8217; place Thursday evening, I spotted Holger Danskes vej, which reminded me of, well, Holger Dansk, but more importantly, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0932633439/">Peopleware</a>. Peopleware is an amazing book about making software projects work. The meat of the book is that most projects don&#8217;t fail because of technological reasons but sociological: unhappy people. Joel Spolsky hits the nail pretty well by calling Peopleware an &#8220;anti-Dilbert manifesto&#8221;.</p>
<p>I know. I&#8217;ve written about Peopleware before. But hey, I&#8217;ve read the book many times and still find it as eye-opening as ever. So if you&#8217;ve so far been able to find excuses for avoiding the purchase, give up. You won&#8217;t regret it.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I could write a whole entry complaining about the (nonexis€ac support of the two Finnish [sic!] makers of heart rate monitors and sports wrist computers, <a href="http://www.polar.fi">Polar</a> and <a href="http://www.suunto.com">Suunto</a>. I&#8217;ll save that for later, however.</p>
<p>I felt a sense of hope when I found <a href="http://www.polarrunningcoach.com">Polar Running Coach</a>, a web-based software for maintaining the data collected by a Polar monitor. Maybe &#8212; just maybe &#8212; they would have been able to create an applet that is able to command the <span class="caps">USB</span> infrared port used to get the data out of my <a href="http://www.polar.fi/polar/channels/eng/segments/products/S710i.html">Polar S710</a>. Unfortunately, I never got far enough to find out.</p>
<p>Someone at Polar seems to have thought it&#8217;d be neat to use Macromedia Flash for the registration process of the Running Coach. It&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s stupid as hell. It totally highlights the biggest usability and accessibility problems in Flash.</p>
<p>&#8220;But hey, 95% percent have Flash player, how could we possibly go wrong with? Besides, with it we can build as great-looking drop-down widgets as we want to. How cool is that?&#8221;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how my registration ended:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=17762636&amp;size=o"><img src="http://photos13.flickr.com/17763350_79e7fc7c0c.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>
<p>Now how cool is that? Especially after spending about ten minutes filling in information about myself. Note that there are no links I could use to back up to the previous step. And as the wizard is made in Flash, I can&#8217;t use my beloved back button because it will throw me in vaults out of the whole registration process. Complete bummer.</p>
<p>Oh, but we still have the cool drop-downs, don&#8217;t we? Using the standard html form widgets I can type &#8220;f&#8221;, &#8220;i&#8221; and &#8220;n&#8221; after I click on a country drop-down menu and I can be pretty sure I have Finland selected. Here, I end up to Namibia (via Falkland Islands and Iceland). You know, sometimes reinventing the wheel just results in an inferior wheel.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that I don&#8217;t really feel like trying again, despite the pretty please. However, the outcome is that I have a €350 heart rate monitor but am unable to download and analyze the data collected with it. The Mac OS Classic version of the old software (that I&#8217;ve never been able to launch on OS X) doesn&#8217;t really cut it.. C&#8217;mon Polar, you&#8217;ve always been a forerunner. Please start taking us other pioneers into account, too.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So here it is, the first ever <a href="http://www.railsday.com/">Railsday</a> 24h coding contest, starting tomorrow at 8AM Finnish time. Unfortunately I won&#8217;t be participating since I will be fighting for Finnish championship in sprint orienteering at the same time. Luckily the organisers have already announced that there will be rerun so maybe I will be able to cut my teeth some day, too.</p>
<p>On other news, I will fly down to Copenhagen next Wednesday. What a three days it will be. I&#8217;ll first take part in the first ever <a href="http://37signals.com/workshop/">Building of Basecamp workshop</a> in Europe. After that it&#8217;s time for <a href="http://reboot.dk">Reboot7</a>,  a &#8220;<em>meetup for the practical visionaries who are building tomorrow one little step at a time</em>&#8221;. Besides making new contacts I will also meet some old <a href="http://openacs.org">OpenACS</a> friends like <a href="http://pinds.com">Lars Pind</a> and <a href="http://unicast.org/">Guan Yang</a> for whom I have a great respect.

It&#8217;s part of FreeBSD <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/es/ports/sysutils.html">sysutils</a> but to be honest it&#8217;s really hard to find these days. Fortunately Jason Hoffman of TextDrive has graciously put up a <a href="http://svn.textdrive.com/repos/scripts/daedalus-1.2.tar.bz2">copy</a> on their Subversion server so your best bet is to just go and grab it from there. Then just unpack the archive in your home directory.</p>
<pre><code>
~# wget http://svn.textdrive.com/repos/scripts/daedalus-1.2.tar.bz2
~# tar jxvf daedalus-1.2.tar.bz2
~# cd daedalus
</code>
</pre>
<p>Now you&#8217;ll have a subdir called <em>daedalus</em> in your home directory. If you look around, you&#8217;ll find a few interesting files in there. <code>daedalus.rb</code> is the actual ruby script that does the monitoring. To save some hassle later on, open the script and change the locations of log and pid files to something residing under your home folder (around line 362):</p>
<pre><code>
$options['logfile'] = '/home/[YOU]/var/log/daedalus.log'
$options['pidfile'] = '/home/[YOU]/var/run/daedalus.pid'
</code></pre>
<p>Be sure that those folders exist, too ;-)</p>
<p>After this, you&#8217;re ready to start configuring your daedalus. In <code>examples</code> you have a file called <code>daedalus.conf</code> which you can use as a template for your own configuration. I created another subfolder <code>config</code> under daedalus and put my config files in there. Open up the config file in the editor of your choice:</p>
<pre><code>
~/daedalus# mv examples config
~/daedalus# emacs config/daedalus.conf
</code></pre>
<p>Inside the config file you find a few configuration examples separated by empty lines. You can comment them all out since we&#8217;re not going to need them. Instead copy this to the beginning of the file:</p>
<pre><code>
name: lighttpd
checkcommand: /bin/ps axww
checkregex: /lighttpd/
onfailcommand: /usr/local/sbin/lighttpd -f /usr/home/[YOU]/sites/rails/config/lighttpd.conf
checkinterval: 30
aftercommandwait: 15
</code></pre>
<p>Here&#8217;s what the above means:</p>
<ul>
	<li><em>name</em> is just a name for the configuration.</li>
	<li><em>checkcommand</em> is the command daedalus executes in order to find out if your target is working or not. In local monitoring it&#8217;s most often &#8220;/bin/ps axww&#8221;. Be sure to include the two w&#8217;s in there, you&#8217;ll be sorry one day if you don&#8217;t<sup class="footnote" id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.</li>
	<li><em>checkregex</em>: this is the regular expression daedalus will try to find from the output of <em>checkcommand</em>. So <code>/lighttpd/</code> means that we&#8217;re looking for&#8230;er&#8230; lighttpd. Brilliant! If you&#8217;re not yet familiar with regular expressions, here&#8217;s a <a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/">resource</a> with a <a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/">tutorial</a> that might help you.</li>
	<li><em>onfailcommand</em>: if the given expression is not found, daedalus will execute this command. In our case this will be the command you&#8217;re starting lighttpd with in the first place.</li>
	<li><em>checkinterval</em>: this is the polling interval in seconds. So 300 would mean that daedalus checks for this particular process every five minutes.</li>
	<li><em>aftercommandwait</em>: how long (in seconds) daedalus will wait after a failed check and relaunch. If you know that your process takes a while to launch, you might want to shoot this up a bit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Modify the config file to your needs and that&#8217;s it! You are ready to launch daedalus for the first time:</p>
<pre><code>
~# /usr/local/bin/ruby /home/[YOU]/daedalus/daedalus.rb -c /home/[YOU]/daedalus/config/daedalus.conf
</code></pre>
<p>You can now take a peek at <code>home/[YOU]/log/daedalus.log</code> with <code>tail -f</code> and see what it&#8217;s doing (if anything). Try to kill the process you&#8217;re monitoring and check that daedalus is able to restart it. After that make sure that your daedalus daemon is started on every bootup, otherwise it won&#8217;t help you very long (<a href="http://jlaine.net/blog/48/running-your-own-lighttpd-on-textdrive-and-keeping-it-alive-too-part-i">part I</a> of this tutorial will tell you how to do that).</p>
<h3>But what if it just freezes?</h3>
<p>There can (and will, sooner or later) be situations when your web server just hangs. It seems to be running so daedalus won&#8217;t notice anything but it doesn&#8217;t serve the pages it should either. Now we&#8217;ll get real pragmatic and see how daedalus can help us to solve even this problem.</p>
<h4>Create an uptime test action</h4>
<p><em>(This advice is for Rails but you can easily emulate it in any environment.)</em></p>
<p>Create an action in a suitable controller that will somehow test that the db connection works and then return &#8220;success&#8221;. I e.g. have an action <em>uptime</em> in my PageController:</p>
<pre><code>
def uptime
      render_text "success" if @pages = Page.find_all
end
</code></pre>
<p>After you have something along those lines working in your web service, add another configuration to your daedalus.conf file:</p>
<pre><code>
name: lighttpd-external
checkcommand: /usr/local/bin/curl http://www.yourdomain.com/page/uptime
checkregex: /^success$/
onfailcommand: killall lighttpd; /usr/local/sbin/lighttpd -f /path/to/your/rails-app/config/lighttpd.conf
checkinterval: 300
aftercommandwait: 30
</code></pre>
<p>Configure it according to your needs and restart the daedalus daemon. After that you should be fairly safe with lighttpd.</p>
<h3>Getting really paranoid</h3>
<p>All Black Sabbath fans can take this approach one step further. Start another daedalus daemon (with another config file) that monitors the first one and starts it up again if needed. Then add another configuration to the first instance and voilÃ¡, you have a redundant array of daedalus processes monitoring not only your web services but each other, too. Implementing this will be left as an exercise for the reader.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s about it. If you have followed through <a href="http://jlaine.net/blog/48/running-your-own-lighttpd-on-textdrive-and-keeping-it-alive-too-part-i">part I</a> and this second take, your lighttpd should survive quite a lot. If you have recommendations for making this approach better, please leave a comment.</p>
<p>Thanks to Jason Hoffman and <a href="http://david.goodlad.ca/">Dave Goodlad</a> for help in setting daedalus.rb up initially.</p>
<p class="footnote" id="fn1"><a href="#fnr1"><sup>1</sup></a> ps ax will only print certain amount of letters to every line. If your command is very long (like lighttpd command often is), ps ax might cut the line which can cause the following regexp check to fail. I spent quite a bit of time tracking this down. The two w&#8217;s will cause ps to output even very long lines so using them is a good precaution for later headache.</p></div>
