  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I for a few years ago was still in PC land, there was a neat little app called <acronym title="Pretty Good Privacy"><span class="caps">PGP</span></acronym>. It uses a public key method to encrypt/decrypt mail messages. The problem with the app was that I never got around to coupling it well with a mail application. Besides, I never knew which messages I should sign or encrypt and which not, and these reasons together effectively made me not to use <span class="caps">PGP</span> at all.</p>
<p>Enter Mac world. I started getting mails with <strong>Signed</strong> tags on them. I checked the Mail.app help to find out how I could do the same. The cool thing was that OS X Mail has indeed built-in support for digital signatures and encrypting and provides a switch to encrypt a message when appropriate. Unfortunately, despite saying how easy things were, the help file never told how to get things up and running in the first place. The procedure for this isn&#8217;t hard, it just can&#8217;t be done inside Mail.app, so a <a href="http://freerange.bipedz.net/blog/Computers/MacOSX/Panther/2003.10.26.HowtoEncryptMail.html">step-by-step guide for getting a mail certificate working</a> came in very handy.</p>
<p>Go ahead, check it out. I find this a very useful and cool feature of Mail.app that has for some reason been neglected by the Apple marketing (and help/tip writing) staff.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>[<span class="caps">UPDATE</span>] The computer actually arrived in just one week. I guess we&#8217;re just one helluva lucky bunch of folks. Or then Apple has sorted out its shortage of capacity.[/<span class="caps">UPDATE</span>]</p>
<p>Just went and bought a new <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/">iMac</a> for my parents this Monday. It&#8217;s the 17&quot; model with superdrive and 512MB <span class="caps">RAM</span>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty excited, not just because it probably means a lot fewer unpaid pc support person hours for me :)</p>
<p>What puts me off a bit, though, is the shipping time of up to 8 weeks. Yeah, you heard it just right. I guess someone else is in the process of switching, too.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m writing this in Leiden, Netherlands, where I&#8217;ve been this week working on a simulation/virtual city project built on <a href="http://openacs.org/">OpenACS</a>. If you ever visit this city and stay at <a href="http://www.dedoelen.com/">Hotel De Doelen</a>, make sure your room is on the canalside. Not only are the rooms bigger, quieter and more comfortable (I stayed one night on the other side of the hotel), but someone also has an open wireless network that can just be reached with my PowerBook. It&#8217;s a two-years-old model with the plain non-extreme airport card, so it needs a bit better signal than newer laptops, but I still can get online by putting the computer real close to the outer wall.</p>
<p>I guess this is one of the upsides of very dense population. We&#8217;ll probably have to wait for some time in Finland, although the commercial wifi networks are getting some foothold in the bigger cities.</p></div>

<p>Letâ€™s say I have a Safari window and an iChat window open side-by-side, with no overlap. I think the Safari window is active, but itâ€™s actually the iChat window. I type Cmd-T to open a new tab in Safari, but instead, I get the Font Panel in iChat.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Agreed. Just closed an iChat window instead of a Safari window with Cmd-w. Thankfully I have autologging enabled in iChat.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As I promised, here&#8217;s a macro/snippet trick you can use to create a ruby function definition in TextMate:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Create a new snippet as follows and bind it to trigger _def:<br />
<pre><br />
def ${1:funcname}<br />
    $2<br />
end<br />
</pre></li></li>
</ol>
<ol>
	<li>Type word &#8216;test&#8217; into a new document (to be used in the macro recording).</li>
	<li>Start recording pressing alt-command-M.</li>
	<li>Press alt-W to select the word you wrote in step 2. Note that this selects the word you&#8217;re in unless you already have a selection (in which case the selection stands intact). Therefore starting a new macro like this with alt-W is almost always a very neat trick.</li>
	<li>Press command-X to cut the selected word.</li>
	<li>Type &#8216;_def&#8217; and press <code>tab</code> to invoke the snippet you created in step 1.</li>
	<li>Press command-V to paste the word you cut a few steps ago.</li>
	<li>Press <code>tab</code> to move the cursor to the second insertion point of the snippet (i.e. in the middle of the def block).</li>
	<li>Stop recording the macro and save it. David Heinemeier Hansson uses keybinding command-enter for this macro and it sounds like a reasonable option to me, but feel free to select the binding as you please.</li>
</ol>
<p>There you go! Now you can just type the name of the function and hit command-enter and get the function body created for you. Note that this technique is by no means limited to ruby or function definitions. You can actually do with it almost anything. Just let your imagination fly!</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong><span class="caps">UPDATE</span> <sup class="footnote" id="fnr041007"><a href="#fn041007">041007</a></sup>:</strong> I&#8217;m now the licensee #75. Who&#8217;re you :op</p>
<p>The long and rainy fall has turned a lot brighter today, as the highly anticipated <a href="http://macromates.com">TextMate</a> is finally here. It&#8217;s admittedly still a bit raw apple (pun intended) but still easily comes even with the huge buzz it was laden beforehand.</p>
<p>Some very handy features:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Handling of projects ala Dreamweaver</li>
	<li><em>Very</em> easily extendable with the built-in macro and snippet features</li>
	<li>Comes pre-installed with syntax highlighting package for Ruby, Rails, and many more languages. Besides that, writing your own language bundle is a breeze.</li>
	<li>Considering its features, TextMate is very lightweight</li>
	<li>Most importantly, TM just feels right. It just sits a lot more naturally on my desktop than BBEdit, not to mention Emacs which I otherwise love.</li>
</ul>
<p>OK, enough of that. If you are a lucky one equipped with an OS X box, go get a copy, <a href="http://macromates.com">right now</a>, thank you very much. If you&#8217;re at all like me and fall in love with the editor, you&#8217;d be happy to shell out the forty bucks for the candy (who said a text editor should cost hundreds of dollars).</p>
<p>As a final carrot, I&#8217;ll be sharing a few macro and snippet examples on this very forum. Stay tuned!</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://textdrive.com">TextDrive</a> announced a new <a href="http://textdrive.com/plans/">2GB/40GB hosting plan</a> and I got into the hook immediately. Well, actually I was kind of needing the extra hardrive space so a 100% increase with 50 extra bucks wasn&#8217;t that bad. Besides, if (or when 8) I get slashdotted, I&#8217;ve now got 4 times as much bandwidth to abuse. Oh, and did I mention TextDrive runs <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Rails</a>? Oh, the beautiful life&#8230;</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>OK, I&#8217;m back after an eventful weekend at the coast. I run two competitions on the Saturday and then we had the housewarming party of my friend in Turku.</p>
<p>The first race was the Finnish Relay League final, I ran in our second team since I was feeling really tired after the military games. The race went still quite ok.</p>
<p>On the afternoon we had the first-ever SonniTonni, club championships in 1000m on the track. I finished second at 2:43, a very good time considering the hard schedule during the previous days.</p>
<p>Anyway, we are moving to a new flat these days, so my posts will still be pretty irregular for a few days. I hope I can still dig into my <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Rails</a> project soon again.</p></div>
