  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m proud to announce that we&#8217;ve released the version 1.0 of Simulation package for <a href="http://openacs.org/">OpenACS</a> (Open Architecture Community System).</p>
<p>The major part of the package was developed by the nice folks at <a href="http://collaboraid.biz">Collaboraid</a> and my job was to finish the project and to make minor modifications to the system to get it ready for launch.</p>
<p>The Simulation package was developed for and financed by <a href="http://www.rechtenonline.nl">Project RechtenOnline</a>, a Dutch project to facilitate and improve virtual learning in law schools across the country.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I seem to have a tendency to find a hotel room right on the edge of an open wireless signal. Last time I was in Leiden my laptop could detect the signal by itself and keeping the Powerbook in right position meant unlimited surfing.</p>
<p>This time, in the same town but in another hotel, the situation is a bit worse. The hotel hasn&#8217;t yet finished its WiFi project so I had already given up on surfing when the owner of the hotel called me today. She told me that the guy living in a room below me had left a message this morning telling that he had surfed the whole night using an open signal.</p>
<p>I of course had to find the signal, too, and I found it strongest in the middle of the first floor aisle. I could stretch the signal all the way to the door of my room, but never quite to my room. Until I got the brilliant idea that if the signal is stronger in the first floor, it has to be at its strongest on my hotel room floor. Well, unfortunately the best coverage seems to on the floor of my closet, and I have to lie on the floor outside the closet with my hands inside. Not quite comparable with an Aeron chair, is it?</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m proud to announce my first commercial <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> project, which is <span class="caps">AFAIK</span> also the first ever in Finland. I will be developing a simple content management system for a firm in the fashion industry (whose name I cannot yet publish) that offers the firm an easy way to publish new product lines and product pages.</p>
<p>The system will  allow them to connect products with as many product lines they want to. It will also contain an extranet with which they can inform their b2b clients about their stock situation.</p>
<p>I will start the project in the beginning of December and the system should be ready for launch before you open your New Year Veuve Cliquet&#8217;s.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve now officially made my first purchase from iTunes Music Store. I bought the whole <a href="http://www.rammstein.com/">Rammstein</a> album <em>Reise, Reise</em>. I would&#8217;ve liked to buy the physical album (since I bought the whole album anyway) but couldn&#8217;t find it from the Amsterdam airport. So I just grabbed it from iTMS. Convenient. Very convenient.</p>
<p>However, I still think the most of my iTMS öhases in the future will be individualögs. If I want the whole album, I also want the leaflets. <del>And as the store has now landed in Finland, how about making some contracts with Finnish music producers?</del> Wow, they got me, there already is some Finnish music. Not a whole lot, though, so it would certainly be an aspect where they could improve. And for christ&#8217;s sake, please don&#8217;t mix ö with o. If I search for songs from <em>Yö</em>, I really wouldn&#8217;t like to browse through all yo yo rap son</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For some reason some files in my <span class="caps">CVS</span> checkout sometimes end up without write-permissions for myself. I can easily change them in emacs shell buffer, but if they&#8217;re already open in emacs, I still get <code>&amp;lt;buffer is read-only&amp;gt;</code> nags. Here&#8217;s how to get rid of that: <code>meta x toggle-read-only</code> or <code>C-x C-q</code>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I for a few years ago was still in PC land, there was a neat little app called <acronym title="Pretty Good Privacy"><span class="caps">PGP</span></acronym>. It uses a public key method to encrypt/decrypt mail messages. The problem with the app was that I never got around to coupling it well with a mail application. Besides, I never knew which messages I should sign or encrypt and which not, and these reasons together effectively made me not to use <span class="caps">PGP</span> at all.</p>
<p>Enter Mac world. I started getting mails with <strong>Signed</strong> tags on them. I checked the Mail.app help to find out how I could do the same. The cool thing was that OS X Mail has indeed built-in support for digital signatures and encrypting and provides a switch to encrypt a message when appropriate. Unfortunately, despite saying how easy things were, the help file never told how to get things up and running in the first place. The procedure for this isn&#8217;t hard, it just can&#8217;t be done inside Mail.app, so a <a href="http://freerange.bipedz.net/blog/Computers/MacOSX/Panther/2003.10.26.HowtoEncryptMail.html">step-by-step guide for getting a mail certificate working</a> came in very handy.</p>
<p>Go ahead, check it out. I find this a very useful and cool feature of Mail.app that has for some reason been neglected by the Apple marketing (and help/tip writing) staff.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>[<span class="caps">UPDATE</span>] The computer actually arrived in just one week. I guess we&#8217;re just one helluva lucky bunch of folks. Or then Apple has sorted out its shortage of capacity.[/<span class="caps">UPDATE</span>]</p>
<p>Just went and bought a new <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/">iMac</a> for my parents this Monday. It&#8217;s the 17&quot; model with superdrive and 512MB <span class="caps">RAM</span>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty excited, not just because it probably means a lot fewer unpaid pc support person hours for me :)</p>
<p>What puts me off a bit, though, is the shipping time of up to 8 weeks. Yeah, you heard it just right. I guess someone else is in the process of switching, too.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m writing this in Leiden, Netherlands, where I&#8217;ve been this week working on a simulation/virtual city project built on <a href="http://openacs.org/">OpenACS</a>. If you ever visit this city and stay at <a href="http://www.dedoelen.com/">Hotel De Doelen</a>, make sure your room is on the canalside. Not only are the rooms bigger, quieter and more comfortable (I stayed one night on the other side of the hotel), but someone also has an open wireless network that can just be reached with my PowerBook. It&#8217;s a two-years-old model with the plain non-extreme airport card, so it needs a bit better signal than newer laptops, but I still can get online by putting the computer real close to the outer wall.</p>
<p>I guess this is one of the upsides of very dense population. We&#8217;ll probably have to wait for some time in Finland, although the commercial wifi networks are getting some foothold in the bigger cities.</p></div>

<p>Letâ€™s say I have a Safari window and an iChat window open side-by-side, with no overlap. I think the Safari window is active, but itâ€™s actually the iChat window. I type Cmd-T to open a new tab in Safari, but instead, I get the Font Panel in iChat.</p>

<p>Agreed. Just closed an iChat window instead of a Safari window with Cmd-w. Thankfully I have autologging enabled in iChat.</p></div>
