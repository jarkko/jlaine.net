  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve now officially joined the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2005/11/full_metal_jacket">path</a> of <a href="http://www.hicksdesign.co.uk/journal/the-new-beast">many</a> and ordered me a <a href="http://www.apple.com/powerbook/">new PowerBook</a> today. I&#8217;ve been happily trotting along with my 15-inch, 667MHz, TiBook until this fall. However, there seems to be some magic connection between expiring AppleCare (or maybe it was the update to Tiger) and slowly deteriorating performance, and the last straw was the dying battery two weeks ago, just before an excruciating 16-hour bus drive to Lapland. Waiting for an Intel model really isn&#8217;t an option since a) I need the damn thing now, and b) I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;ll be a <em>stable</em> Intel Inside version of PowerBook until 2007.</p>
<p>So I gave up. I guess the 15-inch model would&#8217;ve done it for me, too, but being a living-off-the-powerbook type and after reading about the overheating and <a href="http://15inpbscreen.appleplace.com/">horizontal line</a> problems of the 15 inch models, I decided I would go all the road with the 17&quot; beast.</p>
<p>I chose the 100GB 7200RPM hard drive option since I noticed clear speed improvements when I upgraded the hard drive of my current machine. The option was free so it really wasn&#8217;t a hard decision to trade the extra 20GB of space for the additional speed. I just hope I will get the <a href="http://seagate.com/cda/products/discsales/marketing/detail/1,1081,669,00.html">Seagate Momentus</a> drive (<a href="http://daringfireball.net/2005/11/fmj_addenda">see a discussion about the drives here</a>), otherwise I&#8217;m going to get the drive replaced for too much noice.</p>
<p>My PowerBook will come with the standard 512MB <span class="caps">RAM</span> which I will replace myself with a pair of <a href="http://www.ec.kingston.com/ecom/configurator/partsinfo.asp?ktcpartno=KTA-PB533/1G">1GB Kingston Value <span class="caps">RAM</span></a> modules. They sell here in Finland at around 90€ each, so my <span class="caps">DIY</span> work will be worth almost 400 Euros!!!</p>
<p>Of course there&#8217;s no escaping of the robbery 450€ for the AppleCare extension, but I feel it&#8217;s better to play safe with this kind of machine. With a replaced display, power adapter and dvd player, <em>the plan</em> has certainly been worth it for the current round.</p>
<p>The whole bunch will be decorated with a <a href="http://www.marware.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Marware.woa/6/wa/selectedCategory?catalogCatID=126">Marware Screen Protector</a> and a stunning <a href="http://www.freitag.ch/_photoadmin/viewframe_europa.ph€uct_ID=84">Freitag sleeve</a>. One of the creators of <a href="http://map.search.ch/">map.search.ch</a> had such a sleeve in <a href="https://workshop.37signals.com/">The Building of Basecamp workshop</a> in Copenhagen, and I fell immediately in love with it.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;m going to scrap my current €I think I&#8217;ll eventually get a new battery for it from <a href="http://www.newertech.com/">Newertech,</a> along with a second battery for the new beast. It&#8217;s still too good a machine (with a brand new display, too) to get retired, it&#8217;s just that my current needs for a work horse are a bit over its capacity.</p>
<p>Phew! Talk about a Xmas present.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In case you hadn&#8217;t heard before, here&#8217;s some serious news: <a href="http://www.joyent.com/">Joyent</a> is acquiring the ground of my virtual home, <a href="http://www.textdrive.com/">TextDrive</a>. At the same time TextDrive has broadened its buffet and is now also offering hosting for <a href="http://www.textdrive.com/hosting/business">Business</a> and a wide range of <a href="http://www.textdrive.com/hosting/dedicated">Dedicated hosting plans</a>. This all is decorated with a brand-spanking new <a href="http://justinfrench.com/index.php?id=142">website redesign</a>.</p>
<p>The obvious question is: what&#8217;s in it for me? For starters, the business plans sound tempting for someone (like me) who hasn&#8217;t got the dough to go dedicated but still would prefer a bit more stable environment than the traditional shared hosting. The second thing I can hardly wait is that the <a href="http://www.joyent.com/product/">Joyent Mail</a> will become the standard webmail client for TxD before the new year.</p>
<p>One consequence of this acquisition is that <a href="http://businesslogs.com/news/joyent_acquires_textdrive.php">Dean Allen and John Gruber are joining forces</a>. Or, as <a href="http://businesslogs.com/news/joyent_acquires_textdrive.php#5052">Gruber self says</a>:</p>

<p>You know something&#8217;s weird when the authors of Textile and Markdown now work for the same company.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2005/10/drm_crippled_cd.html">Reports say</a> that Sony has come up with a new <span class="caps">DRM</span> system for cd&#8217;s. Not only does the new system <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Spyware/index.php?p=690">use spyware technology on Windows</a> to enforce the <span class="caps">DRM</span>, they also started a pissing contest with Apple on who&#8217;s fault is it that people can&#8217;t copy songs from the &#8220;CD&#8217;s&#8221; (they don&#8217;t adhere to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Book_(audio_CD_standard">Redbook</a>  standard and can&#8217;t thus actually be called CD&#8217;s).</p>
<p>The most outrageous thing in the whole debacle is that the <span class="caps">DRM</span> doesn&#8217;t kick in on Macs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you think that this cannot get any dumber, you would be wrong. The coup de grace of this exercise in corporate stupidity is this:<br /><br/>&#8220;If you have a Mac computer you can copy the songs using your iTunes Player as you would normally do.&#8221;<br /><br/>Words simply fail me &#8230;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So not only is Sony extremely hostile to its own customers, it&#8217;s also dumb as hell business-wise. With the <em>new</em> system people who own e.g. a Sony Vaio laptop, can&#8217;t easily copy stuff from their legally purchased &#8220;CD&#8217;s&#8221;. However, people with Macintoshes churn away with a big smile on their face without ever noticing there&#8217;s some <span class="caps">DRM</span> on the &#8220;CD&#8221;. And the whole point of Sony was to put pressure on Apple. Yeah, <em>they</em> fail me, too.</p>
<h4>Meanwhile in Finland</h4>
<p>I could just bypass this whole thing by just saying &#8220;Hey, too bad, I have a Mac&#8221; if it wasn&#8217;t for the new <a href="http://jlaine.net/blog/80/copyright-demonstration-in-helsinki-tomorrow">Finnish copyright law</a>. The law specifically bans circumventing <span class="caps">DRM</span> systems. The consensus seems to be that a system that even my grandma could break is not <span class="caps">DRM</span>, anything beyond that is.</p>
<p>So is the new parasite hiding on Sony &#8220;CD&#8217;s&#8221; <span class="caps">DRM</span> or not? You could argue that it is, because you need some minor knowledge to get music from it to iTunes <em>on Windows</em>. However, on Mac you just can&#8217;t trip into that trap so it&#8217;s disputable whether it can be called a <span class="caps">DRM</span> system at all. So I might not be criminal even if I copy such a disc on my Mac<sup class="footnote" id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>But wait, there <strong>is</strong> more. The same law also bans <em>discussing</em> circumventing <span class="caps">DRM</span> openly. So at least now I <em>am</em> a criminal. Oh, but so is everyone else talking and writing about Macs since they are from this point on clearly a tool used to circumvent <span class="caps">DRM</span>. So <em>you can&#8217;t talk about them legally</em>. Oh please, dear police, come and get me, right now. I&#8217;m in my office. Actually, come get me from the Zip restaurant, between 1 and 1:30PM, I will be having lunch there then. You&#8217;ll save a bit of tax-payed gas that way.</p>
<p class="footnote" id="fn1"><a href="#fnr1"><sup>1</sup></a> Not that I would ever buy such a fucker. I&#8217;m on a mission now, together with many commenters in the <a href="http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2005/10/drm_crippled_cd.html">original post</a>. I will never, ever buy a Sony product as long as their attitude towards consumers is at the current level. Supersize that.</p></div>
