  <div class="entry-content"><p>In case you hadn&#8217;t heard before, here&#8217;s some serious news: <a href="http://www.joyent.com/">Joyent</a> is acquiring the ground of my virtual home, <a href="http://www.textdrive.com/">TextDrive</a>. At the same time TextDrive has broadened its buffet and is now also offering hosting for <a href="http://www.textdrive.com/hosting/business">Business</a> and a wide range of <a href="http://www.textdrive.com/hosting/dedicated">Dedicated hosting plans</a>. This all is decorated with a brand-spanking new <a href="http://justinfrench.com/index.php?id=142">website redesign</a>.</p>
<p>The obvious question is: what&#8217;s in it for me? For starters, the business plans sound tempting for someone (like me) who hasn&#8217;t got the dough to go dedicated but still would prefer a bit more stable environment than the traditional shared hosting. The second thing I can hardly wait is that the <a href="http://www.joyent.com/product/">Joyent Mail</a> will become the standard webmail client for TxD before the new year.</p>
<p>One consequence of this acquisition is that <a href="http://businesslogs.com/news/joyent_acquires_textdrive.php">Dean Allen and John Gruber are joining forces</a>. Or, as <a href="http://businesslogs.com/news/joyent_acquires_textdrive.php#5052">Gruber self says</a>:</p>

<p>You know something&#8217;s weird when the authors of Textile and Markdown now work for the same company.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2005/10/drm_crippled_cd.html">Reports say</a> that Sony has come up with a new <span class="caps">DRM</span> system for cd&#8217;s. Not only does the new system <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/Spyware/index.php?p=690">use spyware technology on Windows</a> to enforce the <span class="caps">DRM</span>, they also started a pissing contest with Apple on who&#8217;s fault is it that people can&#8217;t copy songs from the &#8220;CD&#8217;s&#8221; (they don&#8217;t adhere to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Book_(audio_CD_standard">Redbook</a>  standard and can&#8217;t thus actually be called CD&#8217;s).</p>
<p>The most outrageous thing in the whole debacle is that the <span class="caps">DRM</span> doesn&#8217;t kick in on Macs:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you think that this cannot get any dumber, you would be wrong. The coup de grace of this exercise in corporate stupidity is this:<br /><br/>&#8220;If you have a Mac computer you can copy the songs using your iTunes Player as you would normally do.&#8221;<br /><br/>Words simply fail me &#8230;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So not only is Sony extremely hostile to its own customers, it&#8217;s also dumb as hell business-wise. With the <em>new</em> system people who own e.g. a Sony Vaio laptop, can&#8217;t easily copy stuff from their legally purchased &#8220;CD&#8217;s&#8221;. However, people with Macintoshes churn away with a big smile on their face without ever noticing there&#8217;s some <span class="caps">DRM</span> on the &#8220;CD&#8221;. And the whole point of Sony was to put pressure on Apple. Yeah, <em>they</em> fail me, too.</p>
<h4>Meanwhile in Finland</h4>
<p>I could just bypass this whole thing by just saying &#8220;Hey, too bad, I have a Mac&#8221; if it wasn&#8217;t for the new <a href="http://jlaine.net/blog/80/copyright-demonstration-in-helsinki-tomorrow">Finnish copyright law</a>. The law specifically bans circumventing <span class="caps">DRM</span> systems. The consensus seems to be that a system that even my grandma could break is not <span class="caps">DRM</span>, anything beyond that is.</p>
<p>So is the new parasite hiding on Sony &#8220;CD&#8217;s&#8221; <span class="caps">DRM</span> or not? You could argue that it is, because you need some minor knowledge to get music from it to iTunes <em>on Windows</em>. However, on Mac you just can&#8217;t trip into that trap so it&#8217;s disputable whether it can be called a <span class="caps">DRM</span> system at all. So I might not be criminal even if I copy such a disc on my Mac<sup class="footnote" id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<p>But wait, there <strong>is</strong> more. The same law also bans <em>discussing</em> circumventing <span class="caps">DRM</span> openly. So at least now I <em>am</em> a criminal. Oh, but so is everyone else talking and writing about Macs since they are from this point on clearly a tool used to circumvent <span class="caps">DRM</span>. So <em>you can&#8217;t talk about them legally</em>. Oh please, dear police, come and get me, right now. I&#8217;m in my office. Actually, come get me from the Zip restaurant, between 1 and 1:30PM, I will be having lunch there then. You&#8217;ll save a bit of tax-payed gas that way.</p>
<p class="footnote" id="fn1"><a href="#fnr1"><sup>1</sup></a> Not that I would ever buy such a fucker. I&#8217;m on a mission now, together with many commenters in the <a href="http://bigpicture.typepad.com/comments/2005/10/drm_crippled_cd.html">original post</a>. I will never, ever buy a Sony product as long as their attitude towards consumers is at the current level. Supersize that.</p></div>

<p>layout: post<br />
title: ! &#8217;[Orienteering] Changing clubsö_This is a letter I sent to my clubmates at <a href="http://www.piforienteering.fi/">Pargas IF</a> yesterday._</p>
<p>Dear Friends,</p>
<p>With heavy but also forward-looking heart I need to inform that I will be running for <a href="http://www.tampereenpyrinto.fi/suunnistus/index.html">Tampereen Pyrintö</a> in the orienteering season 2006. Most of Piffen&#8217;s elite runners already knew this but I&#8217;d like to inform all of you here openly.</p>
<p>The decision to change a club wasn&#8217;t easy. I&#8217;ve been representing Pargas IF all my life, from year 1987, in five disciplines (football, handball, athletics, xc skiing and orienteering), and even on the orienteering side more ööecade.</p>
<p>All my greatest orienteering memories relate in one way or another to Piffen: as a boy watching Kenneönkku&quot; Cederberg run <span class="caps">PIF</span> to a second place in <a href="http://www.jukola.com/tulokset/en/j1997_ju/ju/lopputulokset/">Killeri-Jukola</a>, beaten only by <a href="http://www.halden-skiklubb.no/">Halden SK</a> ; Finnish relay championship in Loppi in 1997 with Mats and Samuli and dragging the prize potatoes (or were they carrots) to the parking lot; sitting our ears attached to a radio with Kenkku while waiting for our own legs and listening while our guys lead <a href="http://www.tiomila.se/2000/">Tiomila</a> <a href="http://www.tiomila.se/2000/herr2.asp">through</a> <a href="http://www.tiomila.se/2000/herr3.asp">the</a> <a href="http://www.tiomila.se/2000/herr4.asp">night</a> in 2000; running the <a href="http://www.jukola.com/tulokset/en/j2001_ju/ju/tilanne/2/0/">second leg</a> in <a href="http://www.jukola.com/?kieli=eng&amp;id=30">Nikkari-Jukola</a> (2001, 5th after my leg and 7th overall) with only a <span class="caps">LED</span> lamp and listening to the &#8220;conversation&#8221; between Elvis Loukkalahti and Jake Puttonen; winning KevÃ¤työnviesti in 2000 and 2004.</p>
<p>All of the memories are obviously not that bright: losing the pretty much certain Finnish relay championship in 1998 because Samuli was selected in the men&#8217;s team; being sick the whole army winter 1999 and the bitter tears later that spring when I fell out of the <acronym title="Nordic Orienteering Championships"><span class="caps">NOC</span></acronym> (and later <acronym title="Junior World Orienteering Championships"><span class="caps">JWOC</span></acronym>) team.</p>
<p>All these and many other memories have created a strong tie between me and the club. However, my own development lately hasn&#8217;t taken the direction it should. The time used for orienteering training has needed to compete with other, accumulating, commitments. Living in Tampere has meant that at least every other weekend has been spent away from home even during the winters. Although this hasn&#8217;t directly reduced my training hours, it has certainly affected the total strain and motivation.</p>
<p>So during the fall a thought of changing over to Pyrintö was slowly developing in my head. Although the decision was extremely hard, the idea of representing my &#8220;home town&#8221; club felt more tempting every time I thought about it. The thing I&#8217;ve mostly been missing during the last five years is training together with with clubmates &#8212; working together towards a common goal. The memories from my time at Aurajoki sports high school in Turku and trainings back in Pargas together with Kenkku are so splendid that I&#8217;d like to experience something like that again. And since my home now &#8212; and many years to come &#8212; is in Tampere, the only practical way to realize that is to run for Tampereen Pyrintö.</p>
<p>I will have many close friends left in Piffen. I will still represent the club in xc skiing, so I will still be seen in Pargas every now and then. I wish my old clubmates all the best, and, mostly, a new coming for the elite and junior orienteering of Pargas IF.</p>
<p>Yours,<br />

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Joel Spolsky <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2005/11/02.html">asks</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does ship-early-and-often really work for a huge company doing massive PR pushes that&#8217;s going to get millions of people checking out their early release?<br /><br />I don&#8217;t think it does.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He&#8217;s probably right and David Heinemeier Hansson is on the same lines (as far as Open Source products are involved) in my <a href="http://jlaine.net/blog/83/interview-with-david-heinemeier-hansson">interview</a>. However, I think Joel&#8217;s got something wrong:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh well. I don&#8217;t remember Microsoft ever shipping anything quite this half-baked. Maybe that means that they&#8217;re moving firmly into the &#8220;agile&#8221; camp: ship early and often.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is a clear misjudgement of agile or <acronym title="Extreme Programming">XP</acronym> methods. Like the pals at <a href="http://37signals.com">37signals</a> say, &#8220;create half a product, not a half-assed product&#8221;. So the idea is not to release a half-baked product early. It is to first create a product that does <em>only</em> the thing that&#8217;s most crucial for it, and does it <em>well</em>.</p>
<p>Otherwise the post is a good reminder of tarpits you expose yourself to if you start a company with a huge VC investment: You got loads of money and have to spend them somehow. You can&#8217;t hire enough talent overnight to spend your budget. So the obvious target for the money become the ever-welcoming ad agencies. So you spend a million &#8212; no, make that two &#8212; to get a few walls covered with your <span class="caps">URL</span> at Times Square. And in a New York minute<sup class="footnote" id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup> your server is melted down by people discovering what you got to offer. And that ain&#8217;t much. And they get pissed. And you get some pretty negative coverage. Not exactly what you wanted. So beware. This has happened. But it ain&#8217;t got nothing to do with agility.</p>
<p class="footnote" id="fn1"><a href="#fnr1"><sup>1</sup></a> My friends just moved to Upper East Side so I can&#8217;t get enough of the Big Apple right now. And Joel lives there. And you gotta love city with &#8216;Apple&#8217; in its name. So shut up.</p></div>
