  <div class="entry-content"><p>First things first: <a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com">Guy Kawasaki is blogging</a>. I know, I know, old news. But if you haven&#8217;t checked <a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com">his blog</a> yet, do it know. The guy (pun unintended) has made an <em>extensive</em> career as an Apple evangelist and later in the <acronym title="Venture Capital"><span class="caps">VC</span></acronym> world. He also seems to have a talent to write thoughtful and thought-provoking articles day in day out. And he&#8217;s got a proofreader for his blog.</p>
<p>But that wasn&#8217;t my point today. Guy has created <a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/02/gbat_score_high.html" title="Guy&#39;s Bozofication Aptitude Test">a test called <span class="caps">GBAT</span></a>, which is &#8220;a compilation of the best indicators of whether a company is sliding into bozosity&#8221;. <a href="http://electricpulp.com/gbat/">Electric Pulp has pushed the idea online</a> so you can easily test if <em>now</em> would be a good time to look for a new employer.</p>
<p>I especially like the point number #6:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your HR department requires an <span class="caps">MBA</span> degree for any position; it also requires five to ten years work experience in an industry that is only four years old.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s like straight from some of the early announcements for <a href="http://jobs.rubynow.com/">Rails jobs</a>.</p>
<p><span class="caps">BTW</span>, <a href="http://www.odesign.fi">my company</a> scored 2. Well, maybe 1 actually, because the only two points came from the point #26:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your <span class="caps">CEO</span> writes a book.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not a real <span class="caps">CEO</span> and I&#8217;m just writing a thesis, not a real book (yet), so I refuse to score the whole two points for that question.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m writing this in a train (my favorite work place &#8212; only the wifi is missing) back from two days of Rails training with the guys from <a href="http://www.reforge.fi">Reforge</a>. As <a href="http://nubyonrails.com/articles/2006/02/10/london-carson-workshops">Geoff</a>, I probably learned as much or more during the training as the students. We spent most of the second day writing unit tests and trying out interface and test driven development while coding the <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives2/product_roadmaps_are_dangerous.php?49">most important part of their upcoming application</a>. We even tried out the <a href="http://blog.viney.net.nz/articles/2006/02/09/selenium-testing">Rails Selenium plugin</a>, which turned out to be great.</p>
<p>I was very pleasantly surprised by how much the guys appreciated the value of testing in both theory <em>and</em> practice. They&#8217;re sure going to succeed with that attitude (and Rails :).</p>
<p>That said, while my rough schedule is pretty much fixed for March already, there&#8217;s still some place for short training and consulting gigs. So if you want to get your team a flying start in Rails development, drop <a href="mailto:jarkko@jlaine.net">me</a> a mail and we&#8217;ll arrange a session.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The second English book about Rails, <a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr_rr">Rails Recipes</a> is out. Not in print, but in the PragProgs&#8217; excellent beta book format, which means that you can get the beta pdf (+ lifetime updates for the first edition) now and the printed version when it&#8217;s ready. Obviously you can also buy just the pdf version. The book consists now of about twenty recipes but will grow to more than 70 during the spring. If <a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/index.html">Agile Web Development with Rails</a> got you rolling on Rails, the new book will hone your skills to the extreme with proven advice for anything from user interface to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration">continuous integration</a>. Highly recommended!</p></div>

This means that you can saturate the music needs of your whole home from a single iTunes collection. No more having to decide whether you want the music played from the living room or bedroom speakers. Reeeally nice.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8230;I&#8217;ll spend my next Midsummer eve in Chicago. <a href="http://railsconf.org/">RailsConf</a> just opened its registration and boy what an event it will be! Keynotes not just from the two Rails-Davids, but also from <a href="http://paulgraham.com/bio.html">Paul Graham</a> and <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/">Martin Fowler</a>. Judging by the amount of interest the conf has gathered, it will be sold out sooner rather than later. So book your place in time. I&#8217;ll try to gather a Nordic Rails brigade that would take a common flight (like <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000417.html">the <em><span class="caps">DHH</span></em> flight</a> from Copenhagen) and maybe share rooms during the event.</p>
<p>This will also be my first trip to the New Continent, which makes it all even more interesting. I think I&#8217;m going to spend a few days more in there, either before or after the conference. So if you have some holiday suggestions, please do share them. The only real thing I know about Illinois are &#8220;The Land of Lincoln&#8221; license plates we got from the local gas station as kids. Oh, and that Tuomo Ruutu plays in the Black Hawks.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I reported <a href="http://jlaine.net/articles/2006/01/27/back">earlier</a> that I hadn&#8217;t yet gotten the old textpattern-style feed urls like jlaine.net/?rss=1 to work with the setup where all requests are reverse proxied to a <a href="http://lighttpd.net/">lighttpd</a> instance through apache. That has now changed. With the help of Ryan Schwartz from <a href="http://www.textdrive.com">Textdrive</a> I was able to combine rewriting and redirecting in the lighty config file so that all my feeds now point to <a href="http://www.feedburner.com">feedburner</a>. Here&#8217;s the setup:</p>
<filter:code lang="ruby">
<p>$<span class="caps">HTTP</span>[&#8220;host&#8221;] =~ &#8220;mydomain.net&#8221; {<br />
  url.rewrite-once = ( &#8220;^/?rss=1(&amp;section=blog)?&#8221; =&gt; &#8220;/xml/rss20/feed.xml&#8221;,<br />
                       &#8220;^/?atom=1(&amp;section=blog)?&#8221; =&gt; &#8220;/xml/rss20/feed.xml&#8221;  )</p>
$<span class="caps">HTTP</span>[&#8220;useragent&#8221;] !~ &#8220;FeedBurner&#8221; {
url.redirect = (
&#8220;/xml/rss20/feed.xml&#8221; =&gt; &#8220;http://feeds.feedburner.com/mydomain&#8221;
)
}
</filter:code>
<p>It might be possible to tackle it with just redirects, but I couldn&#8217;t get it understanding my regexps. In rewrite rules they work fine, though, so I don&#8217;t mind. Here we first rewrite all old school feed urls to the new typo-style, and then redirect to the FeedBurner feed unless the request comes from FeedBurner. Works a treat.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As you might have read from yesterday&#8217;s <a href="http://jlaine.net/articles/2006/01/31/heads-up-for-passion">teaser</a>, I&#8217;ll start a series of articles about passion in web, business and life in general. Although Kathy Sierra&#8217;s blog <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/">Creating Passionate Users</a> has been a tremendous inspiration for the articles, they will not be restricted to just users. But for starters, we&#8217;ll take the easy route and just snatch two thirds of the name of Kathy&#8217;s blog.</p>
<p>The first question is, why would you want passionate customers? Isn&#8217;t it enough that your customers just wisely and cool-headedly choose what you&#8217;re offering?</p>
<p>Yes and no. There are a few reasons why you should love your passionate users like no one else.</p>
<h4>1. They will go to the end of the world just to get your products.</h4>
<p>The single best success story of having passionate users is, not surprisingly, <a href="http://www.apple.com">Apple</a>. I can&#8217;t come up with any other company that would be so deeply loved by its customers. While most people hate (or even worse, couldn&#8217;t care less about) their computers, Appleists adore Macs. While that might seem like a strange kind of cult to outside, to Apple&#8212;especially before the iPod era&#8212;they&#8217;ve been worth their weight (and they&#8217;re mostly healthy, non-obese people) in gold.</p>
<p>In the late eighties, Apple was&#8212;nicely put&#8212;in deep shit. They had kicked Steve Jobs out, taken MBAs in to replace him, and in the process done some pretty brain-dead decisions. Sales where going a-tumblin&#8217; down and all that kept them going was the crowd of users that declined to use any other type of computer. It turned out the best way in the end, but I would be lying if I said it wasn&#8217;t a close call.</p>
<h4>2. They&#8217;re your best salesmen</h4>
<p>Even though the evangelistic attitude of Apple users annoy a lot of outsiders, it also turns many of them into customers. It&#8217;s hard not to think that there must be <em>something</em> inside that blind enthusiasm people show towards products of a single company.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve read the <a href="http://www.cluetrain.com/">Cluetrain Manifesto</a> (you have, don&#8217;t you), you know that in the place called <em>internet</em>, traditional marketing has little to no place to prosper. What matters multitudes more is human voice and conversation, and what could be more powerful and authentic source of that than thrilled, pleased customers. Heck, how do you think Jason Fried earned his Audi S4 with all but zero marketing budget?</p>
<h3>How to get them?</h3>
<p>There&#8217;s no single answer to this and honestly, I can only guess. There are a few obvious &#8220;tricks&#8221; like honesty, under-promising and over-delivering, being true to who you really are and keeping your human face even when you grow. However, it&#8217;s not nearly as simple. Apple has done quite a few things to piss of its customers. It&#8217;s sued rumor sites leaking information about Apple products, but the faithful have stayed. It&#8217;s released clearly unfinished products (the latest batch of 15&quot; PowerBooks, anyone?), and even that hasn&#8217;t been enough to wipe off the glow from its image.</p>
<p>So there just has to be <em>something</em> in you that makes your customers love you. What it is, you have to figure out by yourself. There&#8217;s no one-size-fits-all recipe. Obvious places to start are <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/">Creating Passionate Users</a> and 37signals&#8217; <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/">Signal vs. Noise</a>. The Signals have collected some heat lately, too, but better flamed than mediocre and forgotten.</p>
<p>Next week, 1-3-10 rule squared and a few other obsessed observations.</p></div>
