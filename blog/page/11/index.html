  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m working for the first time on a project that uses the <a href="http://www.globalize-rails.org/wiki/">Globalize Rails plugin</a>. It rocks. It&#8217;s about as close to an unobtrusive <acronym title="internationalization"><span class="caps">I18N</span></acronym>/<acronym title="localization"><span class="caps">L10N</span></acronym> framework as it gets. I&#8217;ve used a couple of approaches before, both self-written and third party, but they don&#8217;t get even close to the ease of deployment with Globalize.</p>
<p>There is one gotcha with Globalize, though, which is probably worth sharing: it overwrites Rails code. This isn&#8217;t such a surprise since runtime extensibility is one of the founding Ruby principles. It does, however, break the backwards-compatibility.</p>
<p>One specific thing that bit me was that after starting to use Globalize, <em>assert_template</em> didn&#8217;t work anymore. Suddenly it started to get the whole path for the template, as opposed to relative from the template root which is the default Rails behaviour. So assertions like</p>
<filter:code lang="ruby">
<p>assert_template &#8220;admin/books/new&#8221;</p>
</filter:code>
<p>won&#8217;t work anymore. You <em>could</em> of course put the absolute path in your assertion but that would break the portability of the app. I guess it would work with constants like RAILS_ROOT, but using it in every assert_template call would be just plain ugly.</p>
<p>There is a pending <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/4235">patch in Rails Trac to accept regexps as assert_template arguments</a>, which would make the problem go away, but until it gets applied to the trunk, I&#8217;ll just comment out the assert_template calls.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>There&#8217;s a lot of sites where you have to select your time zone as part of the registration process. The zones are often displayed like this: &#8220;(GMT+02:00) Helsinki&#8221;. That sucks.</p>
<p>Given that the time zone lists always have dozens of items, it&#8217;s really annoying to scroll down to items further down the list. Fortunately, browser makers have been wise enough to implement keyboard navigation for drop-down lists. Therefore, when selecting a country, I can type &#8220;fin&#8221; and hit <em>enter</em>, and be quite sure Finland is selected.</p>
<p>With the time zone lists like above, I can&#8217;t use the keyboard. Or I could, but I would have to type everything until the &#8220;H&#8221; in &#8220;Helsinki&#8221; and that would pretty much cancel the benefits of using the keyboard. So if you need to implement time zone lists, do put the city name first and the time zone only after that. Sure, it&#8217;s a minor annoyance but they tend to add up.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Many otherwise great web sites/applications, like <a href="http://www.basecamphq.com">Basecamp</a> and <a href="https://www.iconbuffet.com/">IconBuffet</a>, seem to share one very annoying shortcoming: <a href="http://odesign.clientsection.com/login">their</a> <a href="https://www.iconbuffet.com/account/login">forms</a> don&#8217;t use <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_label.asp"><em>label</em></a> elements.</p>
<p>Even if you think <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/fly_on_the_wall_week_of_march_10.php">accessibility is for documents</a> (which it isn&#8217;t), please use <em>labels</em> in your forms. They are not just for blind people.</p>
<p>The <em>big thing</em> for me in using labels is that they effectively make the clickable area of the form element a lot bigger. Which one would you prefer pushing? The male (without label) or the female (with label)?</p>
<form name="test" action="test">
<p><input type="radio" name="sex" id="male" /> <span class="caps">MALE</span><br/>
<input type="radio" name="sex" id="female" /> <label for="female"><span class="caps">FEMALE</span> (with label)</label><br/></p>
</form>
<p>(Of course if you use Safari you don&#8217;t care because Safari doesn&#8217;t support the label element.)</p>
<p>I think using real form labels is a huge usability enhancement in addition to helping accessibility.</p>
<p>For gawd&#8217;s sake, using the Rails&#8217; form helpers to construct the form automatically uses labels, so it shouldn&#8217;t be too hard for two of the more prominent Rails showcases to use it.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>First things first: <a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com">Guy Kawasaki is blogging</a>. I know, I know, old news. But if you haven&#8217;t checked <a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com">his blog</a> yet, do it know. The guy (pun unintended) has made an <em>extensive</em> career as an Apple evangelist and later in the <acronym title="Venture Capital"><span class="caps">VC</span></acronym> world. He also seems to have a talent to write thoughtful and thought-provoking articles day in day out. And he&#8217;s got a proofreader for his blog.</p>
<p>But that wasn&#8217;t my point today. Guy has created <a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/02/gbat_score_high.html" title="Guy&#39;s Bozofication Aptitude Test">a test called <span class="caps">GBAT</span></a>, which is &#8220;a compilation of the best indicators of whether a company is sliding into bozosity&#8221;. <a href="http://electricpulp.com/gbat/">Electric Pulp has pushed the idea online</a> so you can easily test if <em>now</em> would be a good time to look for a new employer.</p>
<p>I especially like the point number #6:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your HR department requires an <span class="caps">MBA</span> degree for any position; it also requires five to ten years work experience in an industry that is only four years old.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s like straight from some of the early announcements for <a href="http://jobs.rubynow.com/">Rails jobs</a>.</p>
<p><span class="caps">BTW</span>, <a href="http://www.odesign.fi">my company</a> scored 2. Well, maybe 1 actually, because the only two points came from the point #26:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Your <span class="caps">CEO</span> writes a book.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;m not a real <span class="caps">CEO</span> and I&#8217;m just writing a thesis, not a real book (yet), so I refuse to score the whole two points for that question.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m writing this in a train (my favorite work place &#8212; only the wifi is missing) back from two days of Rails training with the guys from <a href="http://www.reforge.fi">Reforge</a>. As <a href="http://nubyonrails.com/articles/2006/02/10/london-carson-workshops">Geoff</a>, I probably learned as much or more during the training as the students. We spent most of the second day writing unit tests and trying out interface and test driven development while coding the <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives2/product_roadmaps_are_dangerous.php?49">most important part of their upcoming application</a>. We even tried out the <a href="http://blog.viney.net.nz/articles/2006/02/09/selenium-testing">Rails Selenium plugin</a>, which turned out to be great.</p>
<p>I was very pleasantly surprised by how much the guys appreciated the value of testing in both theory <em>and</em> practice. They&#8217;re sure going to succeed with that attitude (and Rails :).</p>
<p>That said, while my rough schedule is pretty much fixed for March already, there&#8217;s still some place for short training and consulting gigs. So if you want to get your team a flying start in Rails development, drop <a href="mailto:jarkko@jlaine.net">me</a> a mail and we&#8217;ll arrange a session.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The second English book about Rails, <a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr_rr">Rails Recipes</a> is out. Not in print, but in the PragProgs&#8217; excellent beta book format, which means that you can get the beta pdf (+ lifetime updates for the first edition) now and the printed version when it&#8217;s ready. Obviously you can also buy just the pdf version. The book consists now of about twenty recipes but will grow to more than 70 during the spring. If <a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/index.html">Agile Web Development with Rails</a> got you rolling on Rails, the new book will hone your skills to the extreme with proven advice for anything from user interface to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration">continuous integration</a>. Highly recommended!</p></div>

This means that you can saturate the music needs of your whole home from a single iTunes collection. No more having to decide whether you want the music played from the living room or bedroom speakers. Reeeally nice.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>&#8230;I&#8217;ll spend my next Midsummer eve in Chicago. <a href="http://railsconf.org/">RailsConf</a> just opened its registration and boy what an event it will be! Keynotes not just from the two Rails-Davids, but also from <a href="http://paulgraham.com/bio.html">Paul Graham</a> and <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/">Martin Fowler</a>. Judging by the amount of interest the conf has gathered, it will be sold out sooner rather than later. So book your place in time. I&#8217;ll try to gather a Nordic Rails brigade that would take a common flight (like <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000417.html">the <em><span class="caps">DHH</span></em> flight</a> from Copenhagen) and maybe share rooms during the event.</p>
<p>This will also be my first trip to the New Continent, which makes it all even more interesting. I think I&#8217;m going to spend a few days more in there, either before or after the conference. So if you have some holiday suggestions, please do share them. The only real thing I know about Illinois are &#8220;The Land of Lincoln&#8221; license plates we got from the local gas station as kids. Oh, and that Tuomo Ruutu plays in the Black Hawks.</p></div>
