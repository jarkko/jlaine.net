  <div class="entry-content"><p>Often when you use migrations to keep track of your database schema, you also need to migrate data around in the database. You can use the <code>execute</code> method to do this in pure <span class="caps">SQL</span>, but since migrations are Ruby code and have access to all the ActiveRecord code, why not do it in there? Here&#8217;s an example from our latest project where I reverse a has_one&#8212;belongs_to association:</p>
<filter:jscode lang="ruby">  def self.up<br />
    add_column :images, :content_id, :integer<br />
<br />
    Content.find(:all, :conditions =&gt; &#8220;image_id is not null&#8221;).each do |entry|<br />
      image = Image.find_by_id(entry.image_id) rescue nil<br />
      if image<br />
        image.content_id = entry.id<br />
        image.save<br />
      end<br />
    end<br />
<br />
    remove_column :contents, :image_id<br />
  end</filter:jscode>
<p>However, this has one problem. The Image class is loaded and the column information cached before the column <code>content_id</code> is added, so it doesn&#8217;t have the getter and setter methods for that column and thus <code>image.content_id = entry.id</code> will bomb.</p>
<p>Fortunately this is easy enough to fix. Just call <code>Classname.reset_column_information</code> after the column is added, and the new column will be found:</p>
<filter:jscode lang="ruby">  def self.up<br />
    add_column :images, :content_id, :integer<br />
<br />
    Image.reset_column_information<br />
    Content.find(:all, :conditions =&gt; &#8220;image_id is not null&#8221;).each do |entry|<br />
      image = Image.find_by_id(entry.image_id) rescue nil<br />
      if image<br />
        image.content_id = entry.id<br />
        image.save<br />
      end<br />
    end<br />
<br />
    remove_column :contents, :image_id<br />
  end</filter:jscode></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just noticed that I hadn&#8217;t installed the native Ruby mysql driver after getting the laptop back from repair. The reason it took a few days is that Rails just happily churns away with it&#8217;s built-in pure-ruby driver. However, the native binary driver is considerably faster and more stable, so you should never go into production without it. It won&#8217;t hurt having it installed on all your dev boxes, too.</p>
<p>However, installing the native driver on OS X wasn&#8217;t as easy as one would assume. If you have the MySQL binary OS X version from <a href="http://www.mysql.com">MySQL.com</a>, it&#8217;s installed under /usr/local/mysql, and the gem can&#8217;t find it there. You can fix this by hinting the gem install command about the location of MySQL:</p>
<filter:code>sudo gem install mysql &#8212; &#8212;with-mysql-dir=/usr/local/mysql</filter:code>
<p>Unfortunately, this resulted in errors:</p>
<filter:code>Probutanol:~ jarkko$ sudo gem install mysql &#8212; &#8212;with-mysql-dir=/usr/local/mysql/ <br />
Attempting local installation of &#8216;mysql&#8217;<br />
Local gem file not found: mysql*.gem<br />

 1. mysql 2.7.1 (mswin32)<br />
 2. mysql 2.7 (ruby)<br />
 3. mysql 2.6 (ruby)<br />
 4. mysql 2.5.1 (ruby)<br />
 5. Cancel installation<br />

Building native extensions.  This could take a while&#8230;<br />

mysql.c:2015: error: parse error before numeric constant<br />
mysql.c:2018: error: parse error before numeric constant</filter:code>
<p>Googling around helped, and <a href="http://i.nfectio.us/articles/2006/09/12/running-rails-on-os-x-with-mysql-5-0-24">Bob Silva came to the rescue</a>: you can fix the errors by adding the following line to the mysql.c file of the mysql gem (/opt/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/mysql-2.7/mysql.c for me):</p>
<filter:code>#define ulong unsigned long</filter:code>
<p>However, just adding it and re-running the gem install command doesn&#8217;t work. It turns out the mysql.c file is recreated by the extconf.rb configuration, so you need to do a bit of handiwork:</p>
<filter:code>cd /opt/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/mysql-2.7<br />
sudo ruby extconf.rb install mysql &#8212; &#8212;with-mysql-dir=/usr/local/mysql/</filter:code>
<p>Now add the line above to the created mysql.c file, and after that compile and install the driver by hand:</p>
<filter:code>sudo make<br />
sudo make install</filter:code>
<p>That&#8217;s it, the driver should be installed. You can check it by running the gem list command:</p>
<filter:code>$ gem list<br />
<br />
<b>* <span class="caps">LOCAL</span> <span class="caps">GEMS</span> *</b><br />
<br />
&#8230;<br />
<br />
mysql (2.7)<br />
    MySQL/Ruby provides the same functions for Ruby programs that the<br />
    MySQL C <span class="caps">API</span> provides for C programs.<br />
<br />
&#8230;</filter:code>
<p>Note that you might have the native driver installed even if you don&#8217;t have the gem (e.g. via darwinports). You can check whether the library is installed in irb:</p>
<filter:code>$ irb<br />
irb(main):001:0&gt; require &#8216;mysql&#8217;<br />
=&gt; true</filter:code>
<p>If it&#8217;s not installed, you will get something like this:</p>
<filter:code>$ irb <br />
irb(main):001:0&gt; require &#8216;rubygems&#8217;<br />
=&gt; true<br />
irb(main):002:0&gt; require &#8216;mysql&#8217;<br />
LoadError: no such file to load &#8212; mysql<br />

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong><span class="caps">UPDATE</span>, 1.11.2006</strong> I updated the script to build neon (and thus subversion) with <span class="caps">SSL</span> support.</p>
<p>I just got my MacBook Pro back from a repair where its faulty hard drive was replaced. All the data was migrated but the system folder was for some reason rebuilt so I lost the installed Developer Tools, and along with that, subversion.</p>
<p>I installed the latest Developer Tools from <a href="http://developer.apple.com">developer.apple.com</a>, but for some reason they don&#8217;t include subversion anymore. My next attempt was to install subversion from darwinports, but that didn&#8217;t succeed either. It seems that the ports version of subversion depends on apr-1.2.2, but all the mirror sites only have apr versions 1.2.6 and 1.2.7. I probably could&#8217;ve hacked it to use one of them, but then I figured the ports version would be kind of old anyway, since subversion was just updated to version 1.4. Thus, I decided to build it from scratch.</p>
<p>The problem with installing subversion from scratch is that it depends on a few other packages (included in the subversion-deps package) that need to be built as well, separately. So I hacked together a shell script that downloads the current subversion and subversion-deps packages and compiles and installs them:</p>
<p><a href="http://jlaine.net/assets/2006/11/1/subversion-1.4-install-all.sh">subversion-1.4-install-all.sh</a><br />
Usage:</p>
<filter:code>
<p>sudo sh subversion-1.4-install-all.sh</p>
</filter:code>
<p>(use sudo here to avoid writing your password multiple times during the course of the script)</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong> The script worked fine on both my <span class="caps">MBP</span> and a G4 PowerBook. It should probably work fine on any *nix, but use at your own risk. If it doesn&#8217;t work, I will only return the price of the script.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I was young (really young), my aunt told me we shouldn&#8217;t buy  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestle">NestlÃ©</a> products. The company was distributing free baby milk formula samples in third world countries, causing the mothers&#8217; own breast milk supply to dry up. The mothers would end up not being able to breast-feed their own children and thus spending all their money (if they had any) on the artificial formula. This <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestl%C3%A9_boycott">wasn&#8217;t the only reason for the boycott</a> but that was what I was told back then. So I started to boycott NestlÃ©. Since I had no money to spend elsewhere, I convinced my family to be the executioners in my boycott.</p>
<p style="float:right;"><img src="http://web.archive.org/web/20021203005411/http://www.greenpeace.org/esso/disloyalty_card_small.gif" title="StopEsso Disloyalty Card" alt="StopEsso Disloyalty Card" /></p>
<p>A few years later I was working on a website project for <a href="http://www.greenpeace.org/international/">Greenpeace</a> when I stumbled upon the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20021203005411/http://www.stopesso.org/">StopEsso</a> project.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse_effect">greenhouse effect</a> and its connection to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming">global warming</a> were by then a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_opinion_on_climate_change">known and proven phenomenon</a>. Almost everyone agreed, including some of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Christy">most vocal former opponents</a>. Well, except <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exxon_Mobil">one company</a> and &#8211; coincidentally &#8211; one president<sup class="footnote" id="fnr1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.<br />
The message of the StopEsso project was sad:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Exxon <em>[ExxonMobil, whose brands include Esso and Mobil]</em> is doing more than any oil company to block international action on global warming. While the rest of the world tries to stop global warming, Exxon spends millions of dollars sabotaging US participation in the Kyoto Protocol, the international agreement to reduce climate-changing gases. We need to stop Exxon to stop global warming.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I had never been a green fundamentalist, nor even an activist. I support green values but don&#8217;t like people throwing stones at each other or burning fox cages no matter what the cause. But reading that text really hit the nerve. Our Esso credit card never got renewed. I&#8217;ve never voluntarily filled up at Esso stations ever since. I wanted to make an impact, even if a small one. Dammit, I wanted to <em>do the right thing</em>.</p>
<p>At the same time it seemed that NestlÃ© hadn&#8217;t really changed their habits. Shipping millions of liters of still water thousands of kilometers to a country with endless ground water supplies clearly indicates they just don&#8217;t care. In 2004, <a href="http://www.valio.fi/channels/konserni/eng/tanaan/uutiset/unnamed_350.html">the largest ice cream manufacturer in Finland was bought by NestlÃ©</a>. It has made the boycott really hard (I&#8217;m an ice cream connoisseur) but I&#8217;m trying to stay true to my heart.</p>
<p>Even though I feel these incidents have made <em>me</em> do the right thing, my hands  still feel tied. The power of word-of-mouth is strong, but still local. Internet has helped to get to the information, but the information is still fragmented and doesn&#8217;t necessarily have the impact  it would deserve on a company. If there are more companies as unethical (and I would be kidding myself believing there aren&#8217;t), where would I find that information?</p>
<p>It should thus come as no surprise that I was fertile ground when two crazy guys from southern California, <a href="http://www.ryanmickle.com/">Ryan</a> and <a href="http://rod.innovatebig.com/">Rod</a>,  wanted me to build world&#8217;s first social responsibility exchange with them &#8212; a site that would bring the power back to the people, for good. I knew right away this was what I wanted to do.</p>

<p class="footnote" id="fn1"><a href="#fnr1"><sup>1</sup></a> Partly due to their lobbying, it took four years and a movie by an ex-vice president for a layman to even acknowledge the problem, not to mention to take action.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Since people seem to be so concerned about the lack of buzz around <a href="http://europe.railsconf.org/">RailsConf Europe</a>, I&#8217;ll officially start the buzz here. Ok, not officially, and not even start, since <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2006/8/1/why-you-need-to-come-to-railsconf-eu">David already kicked it off a few weeks ago</a>. But I&#8217;ll enumerate a few reasons that make the steep price worthwhile, for me at least.</p>
<h3>Today&#8217;s reason: Kathy Sierra</h3>
<p>If you haven&#8217;t heard about Kathy Sierra or her blog <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/">Creating Passionate Users</a>, you must have been living the last year your head stuck in a dark place. Kathy is one of the very few writers that can write compelling, useful articles <em>every. single. day.</em> No wonder she&#8217;s been one of <em>the</em> blogging rookies of the past two years, rising from zero to <a href="http://technorati.com/pop/blogs/">Technorati Top 100 hero</a> in no time at all.</p>
<p>If I would have to select a single blog I would be able to read on a desert island, that would probably be Creating Passionate Users. Sorry, all you great Rails, hacking, web standards/design and business blogs. But I just can&#8217;t think of a blog with as universal appeal to a hacker-designer-entrepreneur-geek as Kathy&#8217;s. Her writing just clicks. And if she&#8217;s even distantly as great a speaker as she is a writer, seeing her keynote live is probably alone worth the torture of hopping to Stansted in a cramped Ryanair seat.</p>
<p><em>Rails is all about programmer happiness, and there is no better way to celebrate that than the living embodiment of passion opening the conference.</em></p></div>

Now, for all you &#8220;show, don&#8217;t tell&#8221; people (to which I belong), my friend Geoff (of <a href="http://nubyonrails.com">Nuby on Rails</a> and <a href="http://podcast.rubyonrails.org/">Rails Podcast</a> fame) has started a new service called <a href="http://peepcode.com">PeepCode</a>, which provides quality screencasts about Rails development. And, lo and behold, the first part of the series is <a href="http://peepcode.com/articles/2006/08/13/rjs-templates"><span class="caps">RJS</span> Templates</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This 50 minute Quicktime video tutorial shows you how to use the basic <span class="caps">RJS</span> methods from scratch. You&rsquo;ll be adding to your skills and using <span class="caps">RJS</span> to make more responsive and interactive applications.</p>

<p>Go try it out! There is a free 2-minute sample available.</p></div>
