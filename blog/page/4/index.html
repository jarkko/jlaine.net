  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m kind of sad that Blu-ray has taken the lead in the next generation digital video disc race, and that has little to do with the fact that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_BMG#Controversy">I don&#8217;t really like Sony</a>. The reason <a href="http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080211-best-buy-netflix-join-hd-dvd-dogpile.html">the lurking death of HD <span class="caps">DVD</span></a> makes me really sad is that while it has smaller capacity than BD, it has one thing really going for it: <strong>it&#8217;s void of one of the pests of modern times: regional codes.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://adactio.com/journal/1404">Jeremy Keith recently wrote</a> about DVD&#8217;s and Wii games that he bought during his Christmas trip to US <em>that he cannot use</em> because they are limited to be played only by a player with the US region code. Now, there are region code-free players available, but that only makes the whole scheme more pointless.</p>
<p>Now, with HD <span class="caps">DVD</span> being free of the region codes, we could have gotten rid of them once and for all. However, with Blu-ray seemingly winning the war, we seem to be stuck with the same hassle into the unforeseeable future. And people wonder why Pirate Bay is the #1 movie distribution channel in Europe these days&#8230;</p></div>

<p>It turned out I had typed &#8220;sudo gem update zentest&#8221; to get the latest version of the gem. However, the correct way would have been to use the camel-cased version ZenTest. The funny thing is, that if you run the command in lower case (like I&#8217;m use to do with RubyGems), you <em>will</em> get ZenTest, it&#8217;s just version 3.5.0 (as opposed to 3.8 that I supposedly got).</p>
<p>So here&#8217;s hoping that the next time I do the same mistake, this page will pop up from the big G.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>(cross-posted to <a href="http://dotherightthing.com/entries/1481-sony-bmg-goes-drm-free-or-sony-bmg-the-dumbest-of-the-dumb">dotherightthing.com</a>)</p>
<p>Last weeks, the air has been thick about even Sony <span class="caps">BMG</span>, the last of the big four music labels finally abandoning it&#8217;s rootkit-stained history of draconian <span class="caps">DRM</span> schemes and publishing &#8220;at least part of its collection&#8221; available <span class="caps">DRM</span>-free&quot;:http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/jan2008/tc2008013_398775.htm. However, the actual way of how it&#8217;s going to happen has been unclear until very recently. And boy, what scheme that <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/media/2008-01-07-sony-music_N.htm">came to be</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The No. 2 record company after Universal Music will sell plastic cards, called Platinum MusicPass, for individual albums for a suggested price of $12.99. Buyers enter a code from the card at new Sony <span class="caps">BMG</span> (<span class="caps">SNE</span>) site MusicPass.com to download that card&#8217;s album.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&#8217;s right. Plastic frikkin&#8217; cards. Marco has a <a href="http://www.marco.org/275">good view of how this happens</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>To get Sony BMGâ€™s <span class="caps">DRM</span>-free music files, someone burns some coal to manufacture these petroleum-based plastic cards, then delivers them to stores on a series of diesel trucks. I drive to Best Buy in my 3056-pound gas-burning car and find my particular little plastic card, assuming that store carries the album I want in plastic-card format and itâ€™s in stock. (If not, I need to drive to more stores, or just give up and try again next weekend.) But they probably have these cards taking up space somewhere in their massive store that requires tons of energy to keep well-lit and ventilated (since it has no windows).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And as far as the &#8220;part of the collection&#8221; part goes, the <span class="caps">DRM</span>-free collection will be a whopping 37 albums. Three-seven. Combining the convenience of going to a store to be able to buy tunes online, and the width of the supply, I&#8217;m sure people will be buying the albums like crazy.</p>
<p>John Gruber <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2008/january#tue-08-scalzi">links</a> to an article by John Scalzi, aptly titled <a href="http://scalzi.com/whatever/?p=280">Why It Won&#8217;t Work</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Kid #2:</strong> So to recap, what youâ€™ve got here is a system that makes people leave their house in order to download music at their house, and makes them go to a store to get music that they could get at the store, somewhere else.</p>
<p><strong>Sony <span class="caps">BMG</span> dude:</strong> Er.</p>
<p><strong>Kid #1:</strong> Why donâ€™t you just sell non-DRMâ€™d MP3s off Amazon, like every other major music corporation?</p>
<p><strong>Sony <span class="caps">BMG</span> dude:</strong> Well.</p>
<p><strong>Kid #2:</strong> You donâ€™t actually want to sell unprotected MP3s, do you? You want to be able to say youâ€™re doing it, but really, you want to make it so ridiculously inconvenient that people keep just keep buying CDs and DRMâ€™d tracks off iTunes. Just admit it, bro.</p>
<p><strong>Sony <span class="caps">BMG</span> dude (pointing):</strong> Look! Itâ€™s Celine Dion! And Barry Manilow! (runs away as kids avert their eyes in terror)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Won&#8217;t they ever learn?</p>
<p><strong>[<span class="caps">UPDATE</span>:]</strong> They will indeed <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/131515/2008/01/amazon.html">start selling music through Amazon MP3, according to MacWorld</a>. The question remains, why on earth did they publicize the born dead plastic card scheme if the whole Amazon deal was about to be announced. The other question is, doesn&#8217;t it sound like a cartel that three of the big four labels refuse to sell Apple <span class="caps">DRM</span>-free songs but sell them somewhere else? Let&#8217;s hope there are some announcements coming next week in San Francisco.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s hard to write a full book for a seasoned Rails hacker nowadays. Most of every tutorial-like tome will be fluff and even if there are some useful tidbits to gather, they&#8217;re often hard to find among the sea of surely useful but hardly nouvelle information. That&#8217;s why I really enjoy reading concise, to-the-point articles about specific solutions, and there is a genre of books that are chock-full of those nifty solutions: the cookbook style books. <a href="http://chadfowler.com/">Chad&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/fr_rr/">Rails Recipes</a>, <a href="http://tech.rufy.com/">Lucas&#8217;s</a> and <a href="http://www.crummy.com/">Leonard&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/rubyckbk/">Ruby Cookbook</a> and <a href="http://blog.tupleshop.com/">Rob&#8217;s</a> <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/9780596527310/">Rails Cookbook</a> have often made my day when even the mighty G has failed.</p>
<p>And now, fresh from the <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/">pragmatic oven</a>, prepared with tenderness and love by <a href="http://clarkware.com/cgi/blosxom">Mike Clark</a> and a slew of contributors, comes <a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/fr_arr">Advanced Rails Recipes</a>. From a quick look through the beta <span class="caps">PDF</span> (available for purchase now through the <a href="http://pragmaticprogrammer.com/frequently-asked-questions/beta-books">beta book program</a>), this will surely be one of the most useful Rails books for an advanced hacker ever written. Mike has managed to gather a respectful pile of recipes from experienced Rails people like <a href="http://brainspl.at/">Ezra</a>, <a href="http://errtheblog.com/">PJ and Chris</a>, <a href="http://therealadam.com/">Adam</a>, <a href="http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/">Giles</a> and many, many more. Getting access to all these people&#8217;s heads within one book is something really unique and privileged.</p>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: Advanced Rails Recipes contains a recipe written by me, &#8220;Validating Required Form <br />
Fields Inline&#8221;. However, I don&#8217;t get any royalties from the book sales so this recommendation is an honest review of the book. I really think it&#8217;s that good.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Congrats to Sami Korjus and my cousin <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1533154/">Jussi SyrjÃ¤</a> for <a href="http://www.indiewire.com/ots/2007/12/park_city_08_to.html">securing a spot</a> for their short film <a href="http://imdb.com/title/tt0997056/">Harvest Time</a> at the <a href="http://www.sundance.org/festival/">Sundance Festival</a>. I&#8217;ve seen the film now twice, in its premiere in the <a href="http://www.tamperefilmfestival.fi/2007/eng/index.htm">Tampere Film Festival</a> last year (where it <a href="http://www.filmfestivalworld.com/blog/Festival/Tampere_Film_Festival/Post/109/#comments">won the special prize</a>) and last week on the national tv, and the mojo hasn&#8217;t worn off. It was one of the few movies in the festival shot on real 35mm film and the same quality can be seen throughout the whole film. If you&#8217;re into black comedies and heading to Sundance, I heartily recommend <a href="http://www.sundance.org/festival/film_events/details1.asp?filmid=08F0255&amp;filmtype=s&amp;keepThis=true&amp;TB_iframe=true&amp;height=480&amp;width=900">giving it a shot</a>.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s annoying enough that quite a few spam messages creep through Google Groups filters to the many mailing lists I&#8217;m subscribed to. Fortunately, SpamSieve has learned to bash them quite effectively. Today, however, spam on Rails-Core and Rails-Spinoffs hit the new low (right in there with people advertising pirate copies of the first <acronym title="Agile Web Development with Rails"><span class="caps">AWDWR</span></acronym> book on the Rails mailing lists a while back).</p>
<p>A company apparently specialized (among many other technologies, oh the irony) in Ruby on Rails development and outsourcing, iTechArt, considered it appropriate to advertise their services by <em>spamming pretty much every Ruby and Rails-related mailing list on Google Groups</em>. I not only think it&#8217;s pretty darn stupid to crap in your own cubicle (so to speak), I also think it&#8217;s worth giving them a lesson. So anyone considering outsourcing or buying Ruby or Rails development, please:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Do <strong>not</strong> hire iTechArt.</li>
	<li>If you receive a proposal from them, let them know you won&#8217;t hire spammers.</li>
</ol>
<p>In any case, if you&#8217;re a blogger, please spread the word. iTechArt is not worth anyone&#8217;s money.</p></div>

<p>One of the most infamous student dorm houses in my hometown and whole Finland, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikontalo">Mikontalo</a>, is finally put under hammer and renovated to meet the standards of the third millennium. While the construction work is underway, a bunch of <span class="caps">TUT</span> geeks decided to get something more out of the works:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The object of <span class="caps">MIKONTALOLIGHTS</span> is to create the world&#8217;s physically largest colored graphics platform by using the windows of Mikontalo&#8217;s D-staircase as light pixels. The platform is used to play Tetris and other games and present demos created by the students of Tampere University of Technology.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here&#8217;s a video of the grand opening, including rounds of Space Invaders and Tetris (controlled with a mobile phone, of course). Times Square, beware!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My clear favorite among monospaced fonts has so far been ProFont, 9pt with no antialiasing. I don&#8217;t think antialiasing works well for small type and I have yet to see as clear and crisp a font as ProFont. However&#8230; this is what a terminal window looks like after I updated to Leopard:</p>
<p><img src="http://jlaine.net/assets/2007/12/2/Leopard_Terminal_with_ProFont-1.jpg" title="Leopard Terminal fucks royally up strings with slashes with ProFont" alt="Leopard Terminal fucks royally up strings with slashes with ProFont" /></p>
<p>Not cool. Here&#8217;s exactly the same window after switching the font to Bitstream Vera Sans Mono:</p>
<p><img src="http://jlaine.net/assets/2007/12/2/Leopard_Terminal_with_Vera_Sans_Mono.jpg" title="In Vera Sans Mono everything&#39;s fine" alt="In Vera Sans Mono everything&#39;s fine" /></p>
<p>Also not cool because of the ugliness but at least all the characters are shown. Anyone got an idea what&#8217;s happening with ProFont? Everything worked just pristine in Terminal in Tiger, and still does if I run iTerm.</p>
<p><strong>[<span class="caps">UPDATE</span>, Dec 3 2007]</strong></p>
<p>I played around with the different ProFont distributions a bit, and the only one that doesn&#8217;t break as above is the bitmap <span class="caps">ATM</span> version of the font. However, as you can see it&#8217;s just plain ugly with small text size (notice the pixelated k, : and ~).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My friend <a href="http://www.workingwithrails.com/person/5152-martin-sadler">Martin</a> just posted a <a href="http://weblog.workingwithrails.com/2007/10/24/oakley-rails">case study</a> on <a href="http://workingwithrails.com/">Working With Rails</a> about how <a href="http://oakley.com/">Oakley</a> has been migrating their web presence onto Rails. I&#8217;m a big fan of Oakley products. They&#8217;re a company that puts an enormous effort to make seemingly simple products better and better. In orienteering, where you really need some shield for your eyes (unlike in, say, pole vault), glasses with replaceable lenses with different colors for different weather conditions are a must. I&#8217;ve been using the <a href="http://oakley.com/mframe">M Frames</a> for a couple of seasons, and refill my lens stock pretty much every time I visit US.</p>
<p>Martin&#8217;s interview with <a href="http://kenloh.com/">Ken Loh</a> &#8211; the guy running the web group at Oakley &#8211; reveals an interesting point. The guys who actually build their apps got to choose the platform themselves. This is not too surprising for an innovative company such as Oakley, but it does show a clear contrast to the big E word, something <a href="http://www.subtraction.com/archives/2007/1019_if_it_looks_.php">Khoi Vinh</a> and <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/669-why-enterprise-software-sucks">Jason Fried</a> have lately talked about:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The people who buy enterprise software arenâ€™t the people who use enterprise software. Thatâ€™s where the disconnect begins. And it pulls and pulls and pulls until the user experience is split from the buying experience so severely that the software vendors are building for the buyers, not the users. The experience takes a back seat to the feature list, future promises, and buzz words.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In a <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;taxonomyId=12&amp;articleId=9037398&amp;intsrc=hm_topic">Computerworld article</a> telling about Steve Jobs and Apple fighting iPhone unlocking (emphasis mine):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Carolina Milanesi, a Gartner Inc. analyst who was at the London presentation, said she wondered if it matters much in the long run whether Apple stays a step ahead of hackers, as Jobs said it must do. &#8220;At the moment, as a consumer, you need to be very careful about unlocking the iPhone, and know how you want to use it,&#8221; she said. <em>&#8220;If you unlock it, you are not going to have a flat rate, and you will not have access to the 7,500 hot spots.&#8221;</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Huh? A 384Kbps (much more than iPhone can handle) flat rate plan runs around €10/month in Finland. And you have access to each and every wifi hotspot in the world with iPhone.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;If you unlock and then use the Internet and e-mail, you may be surprised€r first bill,&#8221; she added, referring to the pay-as-you-go data rates charged by most carriers in the country and elsewhere in Europe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What the fsck does that have to do with iPhone? You pay what and how you pay regardless of the phone. You probably know what your existing contract charges for data if you&#8217;re contemplating buying and unlocking an iPhone.</p></div>
