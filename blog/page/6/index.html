  <div class="entry-content"><p>There are few authors whose writings literally change your life. For me, <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/">Kathy Sierra</a> has been one of them. She&#8217;s been the leading teacher in how we can cross the chasm between software and emotions, vendors and clients, hackers and users, male and female hackers, the list goes on. I&#8217;ve seen Kathy talk in person and it&#8217;s hard to imagine a nicer personality.</p>
<p>It was thus with great shock and sadness when I read about the <a href="http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2007/03/as_i_type_this_.html">death threats that Kathy has been getting</a>. It made me sick. It made me cry.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2007/03/support_for_kathy_sierra.html">comments made about growing a thick skin and getting used to this</a> turned my stomach even worse. This is not about trolling, this is about threatening to kill and sexually harass someone. There is just no excuse in the world for that.</p>
<p>I hope we can now show the power of the community to fight the abusers and show there&#8217;s no place for such behaviour in the blogosphere.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently updated my RubyGems to 0.9.2. In that upgrade, <code>require_gem</code> was deprecated in favor of <code>gem</code> and running Rails would generate a bunch of deprecation warnings. However, it was easy enough to fix by running <code>rake rails:update</code> in the app root.</p>
<p>Doing the update caused us some problems, though, because we are using the cached_model gem to store objects in memcached. cached_model was required in environment.rb before the <code>Rails::Initializer.run</code> block but with the new autoloading mechanism, it didn&#8217;t work anymore because the Rails classes weren&#8217;t at the disposal of cached_model before the initializer block. Instead I got all these weird errors:</p>
<pre><code>$ script/console 
Loading development environment.
/opt/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/cached_model-1.3.1/lib/cached_model.rb:21:NameError: uninitialized constant ActiveRecord
/opt/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/actionpack-1.13.3/lib/action_controller/assertions/selector_assertions.rb:525:NoMethodError: undefined method `camelize' for "top":String
./script/../config/../config/../app/controllers/application.rb:1:NameError: uninitialized constant ActionController::Base
</code></pre>
<p>Lo and behold, the cached_model docs instruct to put the require line after the initializer block. This is the right way and should be ok in most cases. However, in our app, we also have an observer for the <code>User</code> class, which is a subclass of <code>CachedModel</code>. Observers are loaded inside the initializer block (<code>config.active_record.observers = :user_observer</code>) and when loaded, they also initialize the actual ActiveRecord model they&#8217;re observing (in this case <code>User</code>). But since <code>User</code> subclasses <code>CachedModel</code>, which is not loaded yet, we have a chicken and egg problem:</p>
<pre><code>$ rake test:units
rake aborted!
uninitialized constant CachedModel
</code></pre>
<p>We can&#8217;t require cached_model before the initializer because <code>ActiveRecord::Base</code> doesn&#8217;t exist then, and we can&#8217;t require it after the initializer because it would need to be initialized when the observers are loaded. What&#8217;s a man to do?</p>
<p>Rick Olson pointed me to a list of articles (<a href="http://weblog.techno-weenie.net/2007/1/24/understanding-the-rails-initialization-process">1</a>, <a href="http://weblog.techno-weenie.net/2007/1/25/understanding-the-rails-initialization-process-part-2">2</a>, <a href="http://weblog.techno-weenie.net/2007/1/26/understanding-the-rails-plugin-initialization-process">3</a>) that he recently wrote about the Rails initializing mechanism (+ a link to <a href="http://toolmantim.com/article/2006/12/27/environments_and_the_rails_initialisation_process">another useful article by Tim Lucas</a>).  This lead to a trick that solved my problem. Namely, writing a plugin.</p>
<p>The gist of the trick is that the loading of observers is deferred until all plugins are loaded. So I created an empty plugin called <code>cached_model_plugin</code>, put the <code>require 'cached_model'</code> line in its init.rb, and everything started working again. Woo-hoo!</p>
<p>The weird thing about this is that actually, the code in environment.rb after the <code>Rails::Initializer.run</code> block should <em>also</em> be run before the observers are loaded. However, for whatever reason that didn&#8217;t happen in our case, so I&#8217;m happy that using a dummy plugin helped.</p>
<p>With the new <a href="http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/6212">config/initializers</a> in Rails Edge this hack should become history, but until we update beyond 1.2.X, we&#8217;ll be camping happily with my plugin.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>[<span class="caps">UPDATE</span>]</strong> I&#8217;m now using the new <a href="http://www.plaxo.com/">Plaxo 3</a> to sync between iCal and Google Calendar. Working fine so far.</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve recently found it extremely hard to share my schedule with our team and other people who need to know where I&#8217;m spending my time, I figured out it would be easiest to just share my calendar with them. As it stands, <a href="http://www.google.com/calendar">Google Calendar</a> is by far stretch the best solution for this. Everyone (I mean, everyone) has an account and sharing a calendar in GCal is a breeze. However, I don&#8217;t want to use Google Calendar myself, I prefer iCal. I can sync it with my mobile phone and use wherever I am, regardless of whether I&#8217;m online.</p>
<p>Given these needs, a couple of weeks ago I started looking for a syncing solution between iCal and Google Calendar, and stumbled upon <a href="http://www.spanningsync.com/">Spanning Sync</a>. It seemed like a perfect solution â€” very unobtrusive, doing its magic on the background and only interfering with my workflow if there ever was a conflict. The software was in beta stage but worked still very well.</p>
<p>Last week, I discovered the first problem with Spanning Sync. It would (seemingly) randomly crash saying that the sync failed. I habitually dismissed the error messages a few times until I noticed that the crash was actually not a real crash at all. The problem was that the beta version had expired and I had to download a new version. And that was told me with a <em>crash report</em>. No automatic download of the new version. No button to download it. A crash report.</p>
<p>Well, this was still beta software, so I just commented on it in the <a href="http://blog.spanningsync.com/">Spanning blog</a> and moved on. Now in Chicago, the same thing happened again. Again, a few dismissals before it crossed my mind that I was meant to download a new version. This time, it seemed, they had reached 1 point oh. Great! The homepage had a link to download a 14-day free trial version, which indicated that the actual software would cost something. OK, that&#8217;s fine, I&#8217;ll happily shell out 5 or even 15 bucks for such a nifty app and to support indie developers. However, there were no link to actually buy the application, so I headed back to the blog.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://blog.spanningsync.com/2007/03/spanning_sync_v_1.html">blog post announcing the 1.0 version</a> revealed the ugly truth. Spanning Sync costs $25 a year or $65 as a one-time payment. My first thought? What. The. Fuck? Almost double the price of TextMate, which is pretty much my most important tool that I use for hours every day. The 93 comments on the blog post reveal that I&#8217;m not alone with the sentiment. A quick scan didn&#8217;t reveal a single comment that defended the pricing (except the ones from Spanning Software).</p>
<p>Too bad a promising software is bitten by such notoriously bad pricing. A simple sync app just isn&#8217;t in the ballpark of $65. It&#8217;s not about how many people would be able to pay it, it&#8217;s about how many think the app is worth it. I highly doubt very many will. This <a href="http://blog.spanningsync.com/2007/03/spanning_sync_v_1.html#comment-63345964">comment by DV</a> pretty much sums it up:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Also&#8230;<br />
$65 X 18000 = $1.17 Million &#8230;. nice dream<br />
$65 X 180 = $11,700 &#8230;. reality<br />
$20 X 200,000 = $4 million &#8230;. sweet spot</p>
</blockquote></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We just went live with a <a href="http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch15_One_Month_Tuneup.php">three week tuneup</a> at <a href="http://dotherightthing.com">dotherightthing.com</a>. The main update is the introduction of a wide variety of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_feed">Atom feeds</a>. I just wrote an &#8220;in-depth article about all the different feeds available on the dotherighthing.com blog&#8221;:, but let me get a bit more geeky here.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re using <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.org">Ruby on Rails</a> and the <a href="http://ryandaigle.com/articles/2006/08/01/whats-new-in-edge-rails-simply-restful-support-and-how-to-use-it">Simply Restful</a> stuff in it so adding an Atom representation for a resource like entry, company or user is dead simple: just add a new response type with respond_to:</p>
<pre><code>  respond_to do |type|
    type.html do
      # normal stuff
    end
    type.atom do
      # render the atom feed
    end
  end
</code></pre>
<p>Now, when someone requests the action with type atom (e.g. <a href="http://dotherightthing.com/companies/starbucks.atom">http://dotherightthing.com/companies/starbucks.atom</a>), the code inside <code>type.atom</code> will be executed. However, the niceties don&#8217;t stop there. The new <a href="http://www.ryandaigle.com/articles/2006/09/14/whats-new-in-edge-rails-get-your-rss-atom-feeds-for-free">resource_feeder</a> plugin makes everything even easier. We don&#8217;t need to setup a specific template for the feeds at all, all we have to do is to specify some options that don&#8217;t match the standard and then call render_atom_feed_for:</p>
<pre><code>  feed_options = { :feed =&gt; 
                      {:title =&gt; "dotherightthing.com #{params[:sort]} entries",
                       :link =&gt; entries_url(:sort =&gt; params[:sort])},
                   :item =&gt; {:description =&gt; :body_html},
                   :class =&gt; Entry }

                   ...

  type.atom do
    render_atom_feed_for(@entries, feed_options)
  end
</code></pre>
<p>And that&#8217;s it!</p>
<p>Another great thing about Simply Restful is that all the url&#8217;s are extremely logical. A user profile can be viewed at <a href="http://dotherightthing.com/users/jarkko">http://dotherightthing.com/users/jarkko</a>, a feed for his content is at <a href="http://dotherightthing.com/users/jarkko.atom">http://dotherightthing.com/users/jarkko.atom</a>. The same is true for companies: <a href="http://dotherightthing.com/companies/apple">http://dotherightthing.com/companies/apple</a> â†’ <a href="http://dotherightthing.com/companies/apple.atom">http://dotherightthing.com/companies/apple.atom</a>.</p>
<p>Gotta love the RESTful features in Rails!</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget to check out <a href="http://blog.dotherightthing.com/index.php/2007/02/13/three-week-tuneup-rssatom-feeds/">the variety of feeds</a> we offer at <a href="http://dotherightthing.com/">dotherightthing.com</a>.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jarkko/382599906/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/133/382599906_8de94ec343_m.jpg" width="240" height="166" alt="My new Mirra" /></a></p>
<p>After our trip to Paris and <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/jarkko/sets/72157594520608975/">EuroCabooseConf</a> I brought home my new office chair, a <a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/mirra/">Herman Miller Mirra</a>. I&#8217;ve been looking for a good chair for quite a while, but have been postponing the purchase because of the low availability. In Finland you basically have to travel to Helsinki if you have to test drive anything more obscure than a very basic office chair.</p>
<p>After giving a workshop in Helsinki last week I finally took the plunge and went to visit the only HM representative in Finland. And boy was I sold.</p>
<p>Mirra has been on the top of my list for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
	<li>It is a lot easier to adjust than Aeron and fits most people by default.</li>
	<li>It costs only about 2/3 of the price of Aeron (or Freedom Chair, which has even worse sales network in Finland).</li>
	<li>It is, according to Bill McDonough (the author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FCradle-Remaking-Way-Make-Things%2Fdp%2F0865475873%2F&amp;tag=jlainenet-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325">Cradle to Cradle</a>),  &#8220;the most advanced and thorough application of Cradle-to-Cradle principles a furniture maker has ever brought to the market.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>After testing the chair the deal was pretty much done. Mirra is plain and simple the best chair I&#8217;ve ever used. It offers just the right amount of support and free movement you&#8217;ll need if you have to spend hours each day sitting in one place.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jarkko/382635315/" title="Photo Sharing"><img src="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/169/382635315_15fc5f60a3_m.jpg" width="160" height="240" alt="New chair" /></a></p>
<p>But Mirra is not just a great chair. By buying it I also felt like <a href="http://dotherightthing.com">doing the right thing</a>. The initial four aspects we had when building <a href="http://dotherightthing.com">dotherightthing.com</a> were <em>customer, community, employees and environment</em>. I feel that Herman Miller takes all these four aspects into account in its business, maybe better than any other company.</p>
<p>Good things for me as a customer:</p>
<ul>
	<li>I got the best chair I&#8217;ve ever used.</li>
	<li>Mirra is an extremely low-emitting product, meeting the <a href="http://greenguard.org/"><span class="caps">GREENGUARD</span>^TM^</a> standards. This results in better indoor air quality.</li>
	<li>Mirra is of really high quality (&#8220;Number One design and environmental criteria: Durability.&#8221;) and equipped with a 12-year warranty, work included.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good things for the environment in general (some highlights from the Mirra <a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/hm/content/category/about_us/EPS_MIR.pdf">Environmental Product Summary</a>):</p>
<ul>
	<li>The Mirra chair is up to 96 percent recyclable at the end of its useful life.</li>
	<li>Mirra is comprised of 42 percent recycled materials.</li>
	<li>Every material has been scrutinized down to the molecular level.</li>
	<li>Steel components can be segregated and returned to the recycling stream as a technical nutrient.</li>
	<li>No polyvinyl chloride (<span class="caps">PVC</span>) used; thermoplastic elastimer is used for arm skin.</li>
	<li>Molded polymer back can be recycled up to 25 times.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>&#8230;and much more, see the <a href="http://www.hermanmiller.com/hm/content/category/about_us/EPS_MIR.pdf">summary for details</a>. Following the Cradle to Cradle approach, Mirra is designed from the ground-up not to be less bad for the environment, but rather eliminate the bad side effects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Good things for the environment, employees and the local community around the factory:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The Holland, Michigan based Herman Miller &#8220;<a href="http://www.mcdonoughpartners.com/projects/hmi/default.asp?projID=hmi">Greenhouse</a>&#8221; factory is one of the first designed by <a href="http://www.mcdonough.com/writings/anatomy_transformation.htm">Bill McDonough according to his Cradle to Cradle principles</a>:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&#8220;The GreenHouse&#8221; provides an urbane, pleasant environment for all employees; copious fresh air and sunlight; easy access between administrative and manufacturing staff; and natural features such as wetlands and swales that purify storm water run-off and provide habitat for local birds, flowers, and grasses. The result: a measured increase in productivity, a measured increase in the degree of job satisfaction, and a measured array of positive social and ecological impacts. In fact, the building won Business Week&#8217;s first &#8220;Good Design is Good Business&#8221; award for its documented impacts on the top and bottom line.</p>
