  <div class="entry-content"><p>For me Twitter serves two purposes:</p>

<ol>
<li>It helps me stay in contact with people I know but am unable to see often because they live on another side of the world or just because I&#8217;m a hermit working from home and never get out.</li>
<li>It is a moderated feed of interesting content on the web.</li>
</ol>


<p>These purposes shall thus form the frame of reference for the rest of this article.</p>

<hr />

<p>One cool thing about Twitter is that it can be pretty much spam-free as far as it affects an individual user. Sure, there are lots of spammers around but they don&#8217;t really bother you much since the only exposure to them you&#8217;ll ever get is the single email you receive when someone follows you. You can turn off that notification.</p>

<p>In one end of the spectrum in how you handle followers on Twitter is to act like <a href="http://twitter.com/nzkoz/">Koz</a>: you let everyone follow you, even spammers. That can lead to a healthy number of followers, and the count will probably increase exponentially. The downside is that most of the followers will meet at least some criteria of the word &#8220;spammer&#8221;. This ratio will also probably get worse over time because the more followers you have the easier spammers will find you. But hey, at least you can brag about the hundreds of thousands of followers you have.</p>

<p>The polar opposite approach is to only allow your friends to follow you. This will basically make Twitter what Facebook used to be before it gave in to the dark side. Locking up your updates means that Twitter is a radically different tool for you, because you can&#8217;t use it to broadcast anything to the public. That&#8217;s fine for some people. However, it would totally defeat the second purpose I have for Twitter so it&#8217;s not an option for me.</p>

<p>My policy is somewhere between the two ends. Generally, I let everyone follow me. Just don&#8217;t expect me to follow you back. I want to keep my twitter feed palatable, so I only follow people based on the interestingness of their tweets. There are, however, a couple of jackass rules that do make me block you from my followers list.</p>

<ol>
<li>Let&#8217;s get the obvious case done with first: <strong>your posts look anything like this</strong>:</li>
</ol>


<blockquote><p>&#8220;how to get 16000+ followers in 90 days, fully automated&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>  or</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;RECEIVE GUARANTEED $125 Commission When You Sign Up For FREE Advertisement!&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>  I have a word for that: spam. And not only will I block you, I <em>will</em> hit the &#8220;Report spam&#8221; button. I don&#8217;t care if you are the leading Twitter follower expert in the world. I just don&#8217;t care.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>You clearly auto-followed me based on something I tweeted.</strong> A year or so ago I tweeted about having watched the film &#8221;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000I5Y8FU?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=jlainenet-20&amp;linkCode=xm2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creativeASIN=B000I5Y8FU">Who killed the electric car?</a>&#8221;. I was immediately followed by @evcast, a podcast about electric cars. It was obvious that my tweet had sparked the action, since I had never heard of EVCast and I&#8217;m 100% sure they didn&#8217;t know about me either.</li>
</ol>


<p>  A curious anecdote about this is that while automatically following me annoyed the hell out of me and I did block the Twitter account, I still ended up subscribing to the podcast, which is actually quite good and interesting. I wouldn&#8217;t recommend copying the habit, though. When the guy behind EVCast, Bo Bennett, later auto-followed me with another Twitter account (one for his own content management system product) after I mentioned the acronym &#8220;CMS&#8221; in a tweet, I had no qualms about blocking him.</p>

<p>  Auto-following is a really pathetic form of <a href="http://twitter-fail.com/tag/follower-whoring/">follower-whoring</a>, based on the assumption that people are flattered by you following them and follow you back as a favor. Just don&#8217;t do it no matter what self-acclaimed Twitter gurus (you know, the ones tweeting like in point #1) tell you. Just don&#8217;t.</p>

<p>  <img src="http://img.skitch.com/20100306-cybx79jm7ejgy5ede3k2stx3mi.png" alt="Bo Bennett is following you" /></p>

<pre><code>---
</code></pre>

<p>  The two first points in this list were pretty much black and white rules: break them and you&#8217;re out. The rest of the list consists of heuristics. Breaking one of them doesn&#8217;t necessarily put you onto the black list, but it does raise a flag. Combined, getting two or more hits is very likely to rule you out.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Make each entry start with the words &#8220;New blog post&#8221;</strong>.</li>
</ol>


<p>  <img src="http://img.skitch.com/20100306-ket53taiq86ni3fwjsf9c9tpc8.png" alt="New blog post" /></p>

<p>  That looks like it&#8217;s an automated tweet from your blog software (which it probably is). For me, Twitter is all about authenticity and intimacy.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Make each entry end with a link to your blog post.</strong> Scratch that, make each entry end with a link, period. The link will most likely be a shortened url anyway, so I have no way of knowing where it points to. I&#8217;ll thus assume the worst: <em>your own blog post</em>.</li>
</ol>


<p>  This is a more subtle variation of rule #3 and the same comments apply. Let me elaborate a bit more about that, though.</p>

<p>  This rule is irrelevant if you are an actual friend and thus meet the #1 criteria in my Twitter usage pattern. For the second point, remember the word <em>moderated</em>. I have reduced my consumption of RSS feeds recently in favor of getting my daily fix of interesting content from my Twitter feed. If all you do is link to your own posts, you&#8217;re not contributing to the ecosystem and thus I have no business with you.</p>

<p>  This is not to say you couldn&#8217;t have an automated Twitter feed for your blog. Just don&#8217;t make it your personal Twitter account. A good example is John Gruber, who has both a personal account and another one for Daring Fireball. Of course, the whole DF feed is already so well moderated that I&#8217;m following it as well as Gruber&#8217;s own account.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Follow more than 10 times as many people as who follow you.</strong> Like said, this is not an absolute measure but a heuristic that tells your Twitter usage pattern doesn&#8217;t really fit mine. What it basically tells me is that you&#8217;re following people very aggressively and/or you&#8217;re not very interesting because people are not following you in return. Either way it reeks of follower-whoring. This can be forgiven if you&#8217;re new to Twitter and have only a few followers.</li>
</ol>


<p>  <img src="http://img.skitch.com/20100306-f4paamgierb752a64ipr97m8hj.png" alt="" /></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Follow more than 1000 people.</strong> Same as above. If you follow a ridiculous amount of people it&#8217;s pretty clear that you cannot <em>really</em> follow them all.</li>
</ol>


<hr />

<p>Generally, why do people break these rules? To get more followers. It&#8217;s the classic get rich quick scheme. The social media consultants are today&#8217;s version of charlatans who sell dreams of risk-free, high-interest investments and shortcuts to riches. The asset du jour for companies and individuals alike seems to be the amount of people following them on Twitter or fanning their Facebook page. And the faster you get those numbers up the better, means and integrity to be damned.</p>

<p>So how <em>can</em> you actively earn more followers without me looking at you in disgust? Glad you asked. It turns out there&#8217;s a book about that. The book is called <a href="http://www.cluetrain.com">The Cluetrain Manifesto</a>. It was written more than a decade ago. Yes, you read that right. Twitter wasn&#8217;t even a wrinkle in Ev Williams&#8217;s eye back then, since he was busy starting his previous venture, Blogger.com. However, even today the theses of the book are about as apt and fresh as it gets in regard to marketing yourself on Twitter.</p>

<p><em>Just like markets, Twitter is all about conversations. Write interesting content. Share interesting ideas. Post thoughtful and interesting replies to others. Point to interesting things on the web (yes, some of them can be your own posts). Iterate, rinse and repeat. Keep doing this consistently and you <strong>will</strong> find your readership flourish.</em></p>

<p>We had the luxury of spending six weeks around New Zealand in last February and March, including a visit to <a href="http://www.webstock.org.nz/">Webstock &#8217;09</a>. This year&#8217;s conference is about to start within hours, and while I won&#8217;t be able to attend this time, I will celebrate the event by publishing the <span class="caps">SVG</span> New Zealand map I produced for the travelogue book of our trip (click the map to get to the <span class="caps">SVG</span> version):</p>

<p>The map is based on <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:New_Zealand_location_map.svg">this map</a> on Wikipedia Commons, converted to the only true Kiwi colors, #000 and #<span class="caps">FFF</span>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Update Nov 24: Turned out I indeed was too optimistic. <a href="#updates">Updated the timeline</a></strong></p>

<p>Color me lucky. I&#8217;ve done my fair share to support the online economy, but very rarely have I had experiences that have made me regret a purchase decision. I think before this summer I&#8217;ve only had to cancel or return two purchases during the decade I&#8217;ve been shopping on the internet.</p>

<p>With the aforementioned background, the first truly negative online shopping experience was even more unpleasant, courtesy of Shopping4net.com.</p>

<h3>July 4</h3>

<p>I order toner cartridges for my color laser and some contact lenses from Shopping4net. All items are marked to ship within 1 week in their online store. The order confirmation states July 8 as the expected shipping date. My credit card is charged immediately for the whole amount.</p>

<h3>July 9</h3>

<p>I receive an email saying that the shipment is delayed (without explanation) and that the new expected shipping date is July 13.</p>

<h3>July 14</h3>

<p>I receive another boilerplate email stating that the order is delayed, again without any explanation about the reason. This time the expected shipping date is July 17.</p>

<p>This is the last proactive communication (well, not quite, but more on that later) I receive from Shopping4net.</p>

<h3>August 5</h3>

<p>I&#8217;ve finally had enough and I send an angry letter to the company, where I threaten to cancel the transaction with my credit card company unless I hear more from them, soon.</p>

<p>I get a prompt response to my email where they explain that they had been waiting for the black color cartridge, but now that they checked with the distributor, that whole product is discontinued. The black toner is thus removed from the order and my credit card is credited with its price. This remains about the only thing that Shopping4net manages to handle somewhat well.</p>

<h3>August 10</h3>

<p>The shipment arrives—<em>without the contact lenses</em>. On top of that, the package slip is for a completely different order and client, so now I know that a guy in Western Finland ordered a Barbie overnight survival kit from Shopping4net.</p>

<p>I send another email to S4n explaining what happened.</p>

<h3>August 12</h3>

<p>Customer support replies to my emails and insists that the lenses were shipped within the shipment. They ask what kind of package I received and whether it seemed opened.</p>

<p>I reply with the details and tell that the package certainly seemed intact. I repeat that the invoice was addressed to a wrong client and for a wrong order.</p>

<p>I never receive a reply to my email.</p>

<h3>August 27</h3>

<p>I send another email to the customer support asking whether someone could even reply to my email.</p>

<p>I receive a reply the same day:</p>

<blockquote><p>From some reason the lenses were returned to us so it seems that our shipping staff has packed your order incorrectly and sent the lenses to a wrong client.</p></blockquote>

<p>It <em>seems</em>? No kidding.</p>

<blockquote><p>We will send the lenses to you again and hope they will arrive soon.</p></blockquote>

<p>They never do.</p>

<h3>September 18</h3>

<p>I send yet another email asking what the status of the lenses is, given that it&#8217;s been almost <em>another</em> month and I haven&#8217;t even received a shipping confirmation.</p>

<h3>September 21</h3>

<p>I finally receive another correspondence from Shopping4net. They acknowledge that</p>

<blockquote><p>there has been a technical issue with the order and it has therefore not been sent. The issue is now fixed and the lenses shipped to you this morning.</p></blockquote>

<p>A technical issue? Seriously, what the fuck?</p>

<h3>Later that week</h3>

<p>The lenses finally arrive. There is an invoice within the shipment, which I ignore since I already paid the whole order with my credit card in July.</p>

<h3>October 19</h3>

<p>I receive a reminder invoice from Shopping4net for the contact lenses. I send <em>yet</em> another email stating that the whole order was already paid by CC and asking them to cancel the invoice.</p>

<p>I hope the story ends here, but based on the history so far, I won&#8217;t be holding my breath.</p>

<h4 id="updates">
[Updates, November 24th]
</h4>


<h3>October 20</h3>

<p>Everything seems fine. I get a reply from the customer support:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hej Jarkko,</p>

<p>Tuon korvaavan lähetyksen linssejen summa ei jostakin syystä ollut sama kuin
ensimmäisessä lähetyksessä ja summat eivät siksi ole automaattisesti
kuitannut toisia vastaan. Olemme todella pahoillamme! Olemme tietysti
poistaneet muistutuksen ja kaikki on aivan ok asiakastililläsi!</p>

<p>Kivaa alku viikkoa sinulle!</p></blockquote>

<p>You need to understand Finnish to appreciate the comedy in the quote. Here&#8217;s a translation, sans the broken language, of the relevant part of the message:</p>

<blockquote><p>The sum of the replacing shipment didn&#8217;t match the original so the sums didn&#8217;t automatically cancel each other. We are terribly sorry! <strong><em>We have of course removed the reminder and everything is in order in your customer account!</em></strong> <em>(emphasis mine)</em></p></blockquote>

<p>I wish it was.</p>

<h3>November 20th</h3>

<p>I receive reminder invoice #2:</p>

<blockquote><p>The following invoices from Shopping4net are past due date.</p>

<p>We have already previously notified you that your invoices have not been paid&#8230;</p></blockquote>

<p>Geez, is this never going to end?</p>

<p>I write another email to the customer support. Stay tuned for more&#8230;</p>

<h4>[/Updates end]</h4>

<h3>What should I (and you) have learned from this?</h3>

<p>In a nutshell, here&#8217;s Shopping4net for you based on my saga:</p>

<ul>
<li>They don&#8217;t have a fucking clue about how to run a retail business.</li>
<li>They lie about what items they have in stock.</li>
<li>When your order is delayed because some item is unavailable, they will never tell you about it and after it&#8217;s delayed enough, they won&#8217;t even bother to contact you anymore.</li>
<li>Even if the items you ordered were unavailable, they will charge your credit card right away.</li>
<li>They will implicitly say you&#8217;re a liar unless proven otherwise.</li>
<li>They will not respond to your support emails until you remind them several times and/or threaten them with something.</li>
<li>They don&#8217;t have the guts to admit how they fucked up your order. Instead, they come up with ridiculous explanations like <em>technical issues</em>.</li>
<li>When they ship backordered items, they either out of dishonesty or pure incompetence send you another invoice even if the items were part of an already paid order, which brings us back to the fact that</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Shopping4net doesn&#8217;t have a fucking clue about how to run a retail business.</strong></p>

<p>So save yourself from what we went through and order from someone else. Their cheaper prices won&#8217;t come close to making up for the shitty experience.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong>Note</strong> The actual class will be taught in Finnish</p>
<p>Two years ago we joined forces with Helsinki Polytechnic Stadia to organize a Ruby/Rails class for both students of the school and a couple of attendees from the business world. The class was a success.</p>
<p>Now we&#8217;re doing it again. The name of the school has changed to <a href="http://www.metropolia.fi/">Metropolia</a>, and the venue of the class from Arabia to Leppävaara, but the theme of the class will remain the same: teach both newbie and intermediate Ruby hackers to real wizards that can confidently write their ideas in Ruby.</p>
<p>Because of the joined effort, we are able to keep the price (like really) low, at €700 + <span class="caps">VAT</span> for the whole 4-day course. That should make the class affordable even for freelancers and individuals who&#8217;re just dabbling with Ruby and Rails.</p>
<p>There will be some differences as well. We&#8217;ll use more time to teach <span class="caps">TDD</span>/<span class="caps">BDD</span> and Ajax-related stuff, because of their increased importance lately. Most of the 4th (<span class="caps">BDD</span>) day will be taught by <a href="http://tarvainen.wordpress.com/">Antti Tarvainen</a>, a Rails and Agile wizard from <a href="http://www.leonidasoy.com/">Leonidas</a> who is also famous for his Rails workshop at the Tampere University of Technology.</p>
<p>The program of the class:</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Monday, April 6th</strong> Basics of Ruby, including what&#8217;s new in Ruby 1.9.</li>
	<li><strong>Tuesday, April 7th</strong> Introduction to Ruby on Rails, based on Rails 2.2.</li>
	<li><strong>Wednesday, April 8th</strong> Ajax development on Rails, Protype, script.aculo.us and accessible Ajax.</li>
	<li><strong>Thursday, April 9th</strong> Test-Driven and Behaviour-Driven Development on Rails; RSpec and Cucumber.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since alumni of our previous classes already snitched part of the spots on the class, we only have a couple places left for sale in the open. It thus pays off to be quick. As an added bonus for the fast ones, you&#8217;ll receive an extra 100€ discount if you register within a week, that is before February 26th.</p>
<p>You can register by sending email directly to <a href="mailto:jarkko@jlaine.net">me</a> .</p>
<p>Welcome to have some fun with us and challenge yourself to learn new exciting skills at the same time!</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Early last year I was shopping for in-canal earplugs because I wanted a pair of reasonably sound-isolating plugs that <strong>stay in my ears</strong>, even when running or biking. The standard iPod plugs are not meant for me. Even if I could stand the sound quality (which I don&#8217;t), all I have to do is to lean my head on one side and the earplug drops on the ground. The same goes pretty much for all the &#8220;normal&#8221; earplugs, thus I needed more drastic measures.</p>
<p>My first idea was to buy a pair of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-CX300-B-Earbuds-Black/dp/B000E6G9RI/">Sennheiser CX300</a> plugs, cause I&#8217;d had a couple of different Sennheisers in the past and been fairly happy with all of them. <a href="http://imaj.es/">James</a> proposed that I&#8217;d get <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Shure-E2c-n-Sound-Isolating-Earphones/dp/B000E5GKW8">Shure E2C&#8217;s</a> instead; he&#8217;d used both and thought the Shures were vastly superior, sitting tighter in the ear and being better sound-isolating. I believed him and ordered a pair from Amazon.co.uk, which he then brought to our Caboose meetup in Paris.</p>
<p>In general I&#8217;ve been very happy with the earphones. They sound great, pretty much as good as my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sennheiser-PX200-Collapsible-High-Performance-Headphones/dp/B000089GN4/">Sennheiser PX200</a> headphones. And most of all, after you find the best fitting sleeve for your ear (they come with a selection of sleeves), they sit in your ear like plague.</p>
<p>However, while the Shures have worked really well in sometimes fairly rough use, their cables haven&#8217;t stood up the use as well. The rubber covering the cable first started cracking from behind my ears, and now there are even more cracks where the protective metal coil comes out of the cable covering.</p>
<p>Yesterday&#8217;s <a href="http://twitter.com/lazyatom/statuses/942052102">tweet</a> by <a href="http://twitter.com/lazyatom">lazyatom</a> finally pushed me over the edge to ask for a replacement. I started with the Finnish distributor even though I bought the pair from UK, just to try out my luck. And lucky I was (unlike <a href="http://twitter.com/lazyatom/statuses/943469362">some others</a>). The distributor promised to send me a replacement pair if I&#8217;d just mail them the phones. They&#8217;re now in the mail, fingers crossed that I&#8217;ve got a new pair soon. Kudos for that to <a href="http://www.noretron.fi/">Noretron</a>.</p>
<p>In July, when we jumped on a train for our honeymoon in Norway, I forgot my E2C&#8217;s back home. Two weeks without earplugs just couldn&#8217;t do, so I went shopping in the airport to see if they&#8217;d have some good alternatives on sale. One reasonably priced model that looked liked it would fit the bill was <a href="http://www.koss.com/koss/kossweb.nsf/p?openform&amp;pc%5Eeb%5EPLUG">Koss The Plug</a>. Priced at less than €20, I figured I wouldn&#8217;t lose much even if they wouldn&#8217;t turn out to be good. Which they didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>While The Plugs sit fairly well inside the ear canal, the foam plug is the only thing keeping them in place. The Shures, no the other hand, have the earphone body sitting inside the earlobe as well, and the cable going behind the ear. So sooner or later gravity will pull The Plug out of the ear, and that moment comes very soon if you&#8217;re both sweating and moving at the same time.</p>
<p>The biggest problem with the Koss plugs, however, is that (at least with my iPod Shuffle) they somehow hugely amplify the silent humming caused by a player when it&#8217;s on. That causes the phones to be nearly unusable on lower volumes, e.g. when I listen to a podcast before falling asleep. With the lowest volume I can hardly hear the voice of the hosts from the humming. This is a problem I haven&#8217;t encountered with any other pair of plugs, including the ones coming with iPods. Thus I don&#8217;t recommend buying The Plugs even though they are cheap. Cough up a few dozen bucks more and get a good pair of Shures instead. I&#8217;m at least eagerly waiting for my replacement Shure buds, that&#8217;s how big the difference between the two is.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After my last Ruby on Rails workshop held last year I&#8217;ve often been asked when there is going to be another one. Here it comes.</p>
<p>December 1st to 5th, we will join forces with <a href="http://tarvainen.wordpress.com/">Antti Tarvainen</a> from <a href="http://leonidasoy.com/">Leonidas</a> and give <a href="http://rapidstraining.fi/">a week of one-day workshops</a> in Helsinki with separate but closely related themes:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Beginning Ruby</li>
	<li>Beginning Rails</li>
	<li>Advanced Ruby</li>
	<li><acronym title="Behaviour-Driven Development"><span class="caps">BDD</span></acronym> on Rails</li>
	<li>Advanced Ajax on Rails</li>
</ol>
<p>You can choose as many of the days to attend to as you want to (a smörgåsbord if I may), but <em>if you will join us for the whole week, the last day will be on us</em>. The early bird price is 500€/day, with group and alumni discounts available. The price includes a plentiful lunch buffet (of course), kick-ass course materials and some goodies we&#8217;ll disclose a bit later. The course will be held in Finnish.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m really excited about the course. The last time I gave a Ruby workshop was real fun and I learned a ton from it. One thing I understood while attending Pragmatic Studios is that having more than one teacher really makes a big difference, since instead of a monologue you give the students a real <em>discussion</em> about the topics. I know Antti from a while back and know from his classes at <span class="caps">TUT</span> that he&#8217;s a great instructor, so I really look forward to being able to teach together with him.</p>
<p>Read more and register yourself for the classes from our brand-new <a href="http://rapidstraining.fi/">Rapids Training</a> website. Hope to see you all in December!</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve always (as in from the early OpenACS days) been an emacs guy on linux. Sure, I do most of my development on TextMate these days, but for all text editing on servers I still prefer emacs and have its keybindings tattooed deep in my brain:</p>
<table>
	<tr>
		<td><em>Ctrl-a</em></td>
		<td>Beginning of line</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><em>Ctrl-e</em></td>
		<td>End of line</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td><em>Ctrl-k</em></td>
		<td>Kill the rest of the line</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<p>Of course, these are the default bindings in bash as well.</p>
<p>However, I&#8217;m using <a href="http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/a-quick-tutorial-on-screen/"><span class="caps">GNU</span> screen</a> to stay sane while working over unreliable server connections. Screen uses <code>Ctrl-a</code> by default as its escape key so to make it work correctly, I&#8217;ve had this in my <code>.bash_profile</code> files for a long time:</p>
<pre><code class="shell">alias scr="TERM=vt100 ; screen -e^Oo"
alias scd="TERM=vt100 ; screen -d -r"
</code></pre>
<p>That makes (among other things) <code>Ctrl-o</code> to be the escape key binding and <em>lets <code>Ctrl-a</code> do the thing it&#8217;s supposed to do</em>.</p>
<p>However, I&#8217;ve heard so much talk about <a href="http://friedcpu.wordpress.com/2007/07/24/zsh-the-last-shell-youll-ever-need/">zsh</a> from many directions lately, that I had to try it out myself. With zsh (<a href="http://friedcpu.wordpress.com/2007/07/24/zsh-the-last-shell-youll-ever-need/"><code>.zshrc</code> downloaded from here</a>) the keys worked fine without screen, but within a screen session they broke. Here&#8217;s what I had to do to make everything work.</p>
<p>First, setting the default escape key in the screen alias command didn&#8217;t work. I had to do it in the <code>~/.screenrc</code> file instead:</p>
<pre><code class="shell">escape ^Oo
startup_message off
</code></pre>
<p>(The second line just turns off the annoying splash screen)</p>
<p>However, with this and the default key bindings <code>Ctrl-a</code> and friends still didn&#8217;t work in screen, they were just output as literals on the screen. Some determined googling finally <a href="http://my.opera.com/blackbelt_jones/blog/2007/06/05/zsh-prompt-configuration-issue-solved">turned up the key</a> (pun unintended) to the puzzle:</p>
<pre><code class="shell">bindkey -e
</code></pre>
<p>Adding that one line into my <code>.zshrc</code> among the other keybindings solved the problem. Now I&#8217;m one happy zsh+screen camper, although my journey is still at a very early stage and I&#8217;m yet to learn the more advanced zsh goodies. The nice thing has been that without learning really anything new (or changing any habits), I&#8217;m still benefiting from using zsh.</p></div>

<h3>Going <span class="caps">DRY</span> with multiple elements</h3>
<p>Now that we have taken care of adding items to our to-do lists, let&#8217;s have a look at the the action of ticking items done and undone. The <code>index.html.erb</code> view uses the Rails&#8217; partial mechanism to display the lists of items. Here&#8217;s how the <code>_item.html.erb</code> partial looks like:</p>
<pre><code class="builder">&lt;% @item = item %&gt;
&lt;li id="&lt;%= item.state %&gt;_&lt;%= item.id %&gt;"&gt;
  &lt;%= check_box("item[]", :done, :id =&gt; "#{item.state}_box_#{item.id}") %&gt;
  &lt;label for="&lt;%= "#{item.state}_box_#{item.id}" %&gt;"&gt;
    &lt;%= item.description %&gt;
  &lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;%= observe_field("#{item.state}_box_#{item.id}", 
                    :url =&gt; item_path(item), 
                    :method =&gt; :put) %&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
</code></pre>
<p><code>observe_field</code> is a Rails helper that attaches an Javascript observer to the field in question. Whenever the field is changed (or every <em>n</em> seconds, if the time n is given as a parameter to the <code>observe_field</code> call), an Ajax call (in this case to <code>item_path(item)</code>) is made. In our app, the responding <code>update</code> action will then update the state of the item in the database and return Javascript that will move the item to the correct list on the page.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example of what the list of items looks like to the browser:</p>
<pre><code class="html">&lt;li id="undone_1"&gt;
&lt;input id="undone_box_1" name="item[1][done]" type="checkbox" value="1" /&gt;
&lt;input name="item[1][done]" type="hidden" value="0" /&gt;
&lt;label for="undone_box_1"&gt;
  Buy carrots
&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
//&lt;![CDATA[
new Form.Element.EventObserver('undone_box_1',
                  function(element, value) {
                    new Ajax.Request('/items/1', 
                                     {asynchronous:true, 
                                      evalScripts:true, 
                                      method:'put', 
                                      parameters:value + '&amp;authenticity_token=' +
                encodeURIComponent('8d829cfcccdf4d2b494891ef47cc95893faa361e')})})
//]]&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="undone_2"&gt;
&lt;input id="undone_box_2" name="item[2][done]" type="checkbox" value="1" /&gt;
&lt;input name="item[2][done]" type="hidden" value="0" /&gt;
&lt;label for="undone_box_2"&gt;
  Return bottles to recycling
&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
//&lt;![CDATA[
new Form.Element.EventObserver('undone_box_2', 
                  function(element, value) {
                    new Ajax.Request('/items/2', 
                                     {asynchronous:true, 
                                       evalScripts:true, method:'put', 
                                       parameters:value + '&amp;authenticity_token=' +
                encodeURIComponent('8d829cfcccdf4d2b494891ef47cc95893faa361e')})})
//]]&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Imagine a list that has a couple dozen items. Not exactly <span class="caps">DRY</span>, is it, especially compared to how clean the source code of a Rails app tends to be?</p>
<p>Even if we set aside all the objections for the ugly code above, there is still the issue of the form not working at all without Javascript. Not good.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s again start our round of refactoring by making the checkboxes work without javascript. For that, we&#8217;ll remove the <code>observe_field</code> call from the partial:</p>
<pre><code class="builder">&lt;% @item = item %&gt;
&lt;li id="&lt;%= item.state %&gt;_&lt;%= item.id %&gt;"&gt;
  &lt;%= check_box("item[]", :done, :id =&gt; "#{item.state}_box_#{item.id}") %&gt;
  &lt;label for="&lt;%= "#{item.state}_box_#{item.id}" %&gt;"&gt;
    &lt;%= item.description %&gt;
  &lt;/label&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Now, to make our form work again, we need to figure out what it&#8217;s supposed to do and where we should send it to. Thinking restfully, by submitting a form with multiple items checked or unchecked, we are modifying a <em>to-do list</em>. Let&#8217;s thus create a simple controller for the imaginary List resource (remember, resources don&#8217;t need to map directly to ActiveRecord models).</p>
<pre><code>script/generate controller Lists</code></pre>
<p>Then add the necessary route to <code>config/routes.rb</code></p>
<pre><code class="ruby">  map.resources :items
  map.resource :list
</code></pre>
<p>For simplicity&#8217;s sake, let&#8217;s pretend our app can only handle a single to-do list (it&#8217;s our personal to-do list app, after all) and use the single form of resource routes with it.</p>
<p>In our to-do list page, we currently have a form that&#8217;s unable to submit anything. Let&#8217;s add a submit button to it and also change the form in <code>app/views/items/index.html.erb</code> to point to the lists controller:</p>
<pre><code class="builder">&lt;% form_for :list, :url =&gt; list_path, :html =&gt; {:method =&gt; :put} do |f| %&gt;
  &lt;h3&gt;
    Not done:
  &lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;ul id="undone"&gt;
    &lt;%= render :partial =&gt; "item", :collection =&gt; @not_done %&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;h3&gt;
    Done:
  &lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;ul id="done"&gt;
    &lt;%= render :partial =&gt; "item", :collection =&gt; @done %&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;%= submit_tag "Save changes", :id =&gt; "save_changes" %&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;% end %&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Now let&#8217;s create a really simple update action to our new controller for the mass assignment of items:</p>
<pre><code class="ruby">class ListsController &lt; ApplicationController
  def update
    params[:item].each do |key, values|
      item = Item.find(key)
      item.update_attributes(values)
    end
    
    redirect_to items_path
  end
end
</code></pre>
<p>If you now test the application with Javascript turned off, updating the item state should work fine. We can thus continue to the hijacking phase.</p>
<p>First of all, let&#8217;s hide the submit button because we don&#8217;t need it in the Ajax&#8217;ed form.</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">Event.addBehavior({
  'body' : function() {
    $('add_form').hide();
    $('add_new_link').show();
    $('save_changes').hide();
  },
  '#add_new_link:click' : function(e) {
    $('add_form').toggle();
    e.stop();
  },
  '#add_form' : Remote.Form
});
</code></pre>
<p>Now, what we need to do is to make clicking a checkbox to call the update action for the current item. This is easily done in the js file:</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">Event.addBehavior({
  'body' : function() {
    $('add_form').hide();
    $('add_new_link').show();
    $('save_changes').hide();
  },
  '#add_new_link:click' : function(e) {
    $('add_form').toggle();
    e.stop();
  },
  '#add_form' : Remote.Form,
  'input[type=checkbox]:click' : function() {
    var id = this.id.match(/\d{1,}$/);
    var auth_token = this.up('form').
                          select('[name=authenticity_token]').
                          first().value;
    new Ajax.Request('/items/' + id, 
                     {asynchronous:true, 
                      evalScripts:true, 
                      method: 'put',
                      parameters: {
                        authenticity_token: auth_token
                      }});
  }
});
</code></pre>
<p>We use the CSS3 selector syntax to get every input of type checkbox, then fetch the item id from the element id using a regular expression and finally call the update method of the items controller to update the item. The cool thing about <code>addBehaviour</code> is that the behaviour is attached to all elements returned by the selector. Thus adding a single call function to our javascript file automatically attaches the function to as many list items as needed.</p>
<p>Note that because of the spam-defense mechanism in Rails, we also need to send the authenticity token with our call. We use the cool Prototype selector functions to easily get to the current token inside the form.</p>
<p>An astute reader might have noticed that if you click an item in the list, and then try to re-click the same item after it&#8217;s moved to the opposing list, it&#8217;s not moved back automatically. This is because our Ajax update action created a new list item and added it to the list, and by default <code>Event.addBehaviour</code> does not reattach behaviours after each Ajax call.</p>
<p>We have a couple of ways to fix the situation. The simplest would be to add this line to our Javascript file:</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">Event.addBehavior.reassignAfterAjax = true;</code></pre>
<p>However, the simplest way is not always the best. By reassigning behaviours automatically after each Ajax call we can deteriorate the Javascript performance considerably, and the effect gets larger when there are more items watched.</p>
<p>Second, a bit more surgical option would be to reload the <code>addBehaviour</code> rules in a callback of the Ajax call:</p>
<pre><code class="javascript">onComplete : function() {
  Event.addBehavior.reload();
}
</code></pre>
<p>This way the behaviours would only be reassigned after the particular Ajax call, not all of them. However, it&#8217;s still a bit heavy-handed.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a step back and think how we could avoid reassigning all the behaviours for the new element. An obvious answer would of course be not to create a new element at all, but instead just move the existing one (with all the behaviours already attached).</p>
<p>In app/views/items/update.js.rjs we can see that the code first removes a list item and then adds a new one into the list of items in the opposite state:</p>
<pre><code class="ruby">page["#{@item.opposite_state}_#{@item.id}"].remove
page.insert_html :top, @item.state, :partial =&gt; "item"
</code></pre>
<p>We can fairly easily change that code to not delete/create a new node to the page, but instead move the list item to the correct place in the <span class="caps">DOM</span>:</p>
<pre><code class="builder">page &lt;&lt; "
  var el = $('#{@item.opposite_state}_#{@item.id}');
  $('#{@item.state}').insert({ top: el.remove() });
  el.id = '#{@item.state}_#{@item.id}';
"
</code></pre>
<p>This time we don&#8217;t use the <span class="caps">RJS</span> syntax but instead just output plain old Javascript back to the browser. We first fetch the list element we&#8217;re about to move. We then remove it from the <span class="caps">DOM</span> tree, just to again insert it to the bottom of the list it now belongs to. In the end we change the id of the item to reflect its new state as well.</p>
<p>If you now try the app again, you should be able to tick and untick the items at will, and everything should work just fine. The behaviour assigned to the list element on the page load sticks to it through all the moving and renaming of the element.</p>
