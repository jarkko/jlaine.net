<blockquote>
<p>The Tokyo District Court has ordered the destruction of Ichitaro, a software product that is the only serious competitor in Japan to Microsoft Word, and has been on sale since 1985. The ruling is based on the claim of a competitor, Matsushita, that the use of a help icon to invoke a help function infinges on one of their patents. &#8216;We are a global enterprise and we are just following international practice to enforce our IP rights,&#8217; Kitadeya (Matsushita) said.&quot;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been an avid user of <a href="http://wsmanager.sourceforge.net/">Desktop Manager</a> ever since I learned about it.

<p><a href="http://virtuedesktops.sourceforge.net/">Virtue</a> is built on the shoulders of Desktop Manager and tries to get around the biggest cons of its predecessor.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Rails version 0.9.4.1 is out and ohmigod. The framework is going forward so fast I have trouble following up with all the new stuff. Here&#8217;s the greatest of <a href="http://weblog.rubyonrails.com/archives/2005/01/17/rails-094-caching-filters-sqlite3/">the latest</a>: <a href="http://ap.rubyonrails.com/classes/ActionController/Caching.html">Caching</a>.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, caching is no news as such. It&#8217;s the way David implemented it (just like other things) in Rails that can&#8217;t stop astounding me. It&#8217;s so simple it almost makes me cry. Want to <a href="http://ap.rubyonrails.com/classes/ActionController/Caching/Pages.html">cache some whole pages</a> your controller is serving? Just do this:</p>
<pre><code>
  class WeblogController &lt; ActionController::Base
    caches_page :show, :new
  end
</code></pre>
<p>Phew, that was all good and well. But what if you have some personalized content? You can&#8217;t cache whole pages then, can you? That&#8217;s right, dear Watson. But you can cache the actions. Using <a href="http://ap.rubyonrails.com/classes/ActionController/Caching/Actions.html"><em>action caching</em></a> means that the request will go trough Action Pack so all the filters are processed before the page gets served. That way you can use authentication and other magic in your pages without having to give up the glory of caching. Here&#8217;s an example of controller that uses both page <em>and</em> action caching, stolen straight from the api docs:</p>
<pre><code>
  class ListsController &lt; ApplicationController
    before_filter :authenticate, :except =&gt; :public
    caches_page   :public
    caches_action :show, :feed
  end
</code></pre>
<p>This controller has a public action and two private actions that need authentication &#8212; and thus action-level caching.</p>
<p>The most granular way to do caching in Rails is <a href="http://ap.rubyonrails.com/classes/ActionController/Caching/Fragments.html"><em>fragment caching</em></a>. It&#8217;s what the two higher-level caching schemes use internally. Using fragment caching is a gem when you have pages that have both highly dynamic and pretty static parts. The downside is that it&#8217;s a bit more work and you have to do it in templates. Here&#8217;s an example of fragment caching:</p>
<pre><code>
  &lt;b&gt;Hello &lt;%= @name %&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
  &lt;% cache(binding) do %&gt;
    All the topics in the system:
    &lt;%= render_collection_of_partials "topic", Topic.find_all %&gt;
  &lt;% end %&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>There. But, wait! What if the content changes in between. Will the users be served old stinkin&#8217; cheese ever after. Glad you asked. It turns out David <em>did</em> notice this possibility. That&#8217;s why controllers now have methods like <code>expire_page</code>, <code>expire_action</code> and <code>expire_fragment</code>, for all you busy bees who can&#8217;t settle with the content you once created. Here&#8217;s an action where the cache for page <em>show</em> is flushed:</p>
<pre><code>
  class WeblogController &lt; ActionController::Base
    def update
      List.update(@params["list"]["id"], @params["list"])
      expire_page :action =&gt; "show", :id =&gt; @params["list"]["id"]
      redirect_to :action =&gt; "show", :id =&gt; @params["list"]["id"]
    end
  end
</code></pre>
<p>OK, enough rambling. Now, go create some apps swift as an arrow.</p>
<p>Oh, one more thing. Rails can use a bunch of different methods to store the cache. But that&#8217;s <a href="http://ap.rubyonrails.com/classes/ActionController/Caching/Fragments.html">another story</a>.</p></div>

<p>Sorry for my absence from here. I spent last week in <a href="http://www.vuokatti.fi/lang/toiminto.php?mid=4_127&amp;la=uk">Vuokatti</a>, an XC skiing paradise in Northeastern Finland. With no internet connection. That can be a relaxing experience, mind you. Well, ok, I checked my email every now and then with my cellphone, but with no serious job-related thoughts involved.</p>

<p>Anyway, the week was pretty productive. 26,5 hours and 359 kilometers of training in 8 days is pretty near my training record. And two of those days were travel days. The weather was excellent, most of the week between 0 and -10 Â°C and sunny.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><h4>Background</h4>
<p>Simulation is an OpenACS package originally developed by <a href="http:/collaboraid.biz">Collaboraid</a> for project <a href="http:www.rechtenonline.nl">RechtenOnline</a>, a consortium of Dutch law faculties. As Collaboraid was having a lack of resources last fall, I was hired to finish the system. Version 1.0 of system was released in the end of November and a revised version 1.0.1 just before Christmas.</p>
<p>Simulation is a package which can be used to simulate virtually any common workflows and processes. The most common example used by the original clients is the setting of a new law, with multiple students playing different roles in the process. Simulation is based on the newer, Finite State Machine Workflow package of OpenACS.</p>
<h4>The Proposal</h4>
<p>My proposal is to integrate the Simulation package with .<span class="caps">LRN</span> because the target audience of the two is clearly orthogonal.</p>
<h4>Why would .<span class="caps">LRN</span> benefit</h4>
<p>Integrating Simulation with .<span class="caps">LRN</span> would give it another member in its already extensive set of collaborative tools.</p>
<h4>The Deliverable</h4>
<p>Simulation package will be possible to be installed as a part of .<span class="caps">LRN</span> and they will work seamlessly together. I will also create all the needed portlet packages for both normal users and simulation administrators. All the code will be committed to the OpenACS codebase (as simulation already is). As a part of this project I will also take care that the end-user documentation of Simulation will be taken to a level expected from a .<span class="caps">LRN</span> package.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h4>Background</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/" title="A Simple Standards-Based Slide Show System">S^5^</a> is a standards-based slide-show presentation system developed by <span class="caps">CSS</span> guru <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com">Eric Meyer</a>. It&#8217;s fully based on <span class="caps">XHTML</span>, <span class="caps">CSS</span> and W3C <span class="caps">DOM</span>, thus making it work in virtually all modern web browsers. An S^5^ presentation consists of a single <span class="caps">XHTML</span> file, so for users of browsers that don&#8217;t support standards the presentation is presented as a plain web page, without losing anything of the content. S^5^ is licensed under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/">Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 2.0 License</a></p>
<h4>So where&#8217;s the benefit?</h4>
<p>Wimpypoint is a great tool in conjunction to .<span class="caps">LRN</span>. It makes it possible to integrate lecture slides to other course material. However, as it presents every slide as an individual html page, using it for presenting is kind of clunky. An S^5^ presentation, on the other hand, consists of a single page and supports all the usual slide-navigating keys (see the <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/s5-intro.html">introductory slide show</a> for examples), making it responsive to the point where it competes head-to-head with desktop products like Apple Keynote and Microsoft Powerpoint. Additionally, because of the single-file paradigm S^5^ makes it a whole lot easier to export a presentation for offline situations.</p>
<h4>The Deliverable</h4>
<p>The Wimpypoint package will use S^5^ as its primary presentation mechanism. The old mechanism can be kept as an alternative method for backwards-compatibility if needed. Wimpypoint will also sport an export function which will export the presentation and all related files as a zip (or equiv.) package for offline presenting. Also the templating system of Wimpypoint will be integrated with S^5^. I will also do everything that is needed for fully integrating the revised package with .<span class="caps">LRN</span>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h4>Background</h4>
<p>The <em>admin backend</em> is a major part of a web framework like OpenACS. As Philip Greenspun once noted, roughly half of all the pages in a dynamic website are more or less admin pages. Making administrating a system a pleasure is vital for any system, including OpenACS.</p>
<p><a href="http://37signals.com">37signals</a> published a book called <a href="http://37signals.com/book/index.php">Defensive Design for the Web</a> last spring. The book was lately selected as <a href="http://www.37signals.com/svn/archives/000999.php">the best web design book of 2004</a>. <cite>Defensive Design for the Web</cite> is about improving the contingency design of a website, including e.g. error messages, help and forms. The book also provides a heuristics to analyze the contingency level of a service.</p>
<h4>The Proposal</h4>
<p>I will go through all the major OpenACS components, including core and .<span class="caps">LRN</span>, and analyze their contingency design level with the help of heuristics developed by 37signals. As a result of this analysis, I will improve the administrative and end-user visible interfaces to the point where they will score at least 80% of the applicable parts of the test.</p>
<h4>The deliverable</h4>
<p>A system that is slicker and more pleasurable to use out-of-the-box. The UI of OpenACS has gotten a lot better lately, but has still room for improvement.</p>
<p>Concrete improvements include e.g.:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Real double-click protection. Adding functions to ad_form that disable buttons when one is clicked and give a visual clue that the process has started. Current double-click protection protects from duplicate entries but results often in user-visible errors.</li>
	<li>Improved error pages.</li>
	<li>Improved &#8220;inter-page&#8221; notification/error message delivery and display system.</li>
</ul>
