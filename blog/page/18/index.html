  <div class="entry-content"><p>Announcements about Rails-related books seem to be popping up like mushrooms in the rain today. First, Scott Barron (and later <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000426.html"><span class="caps">DHH</span></a>) <a href="http://scott.elitists.net/scott/pragmatic-rails-recipes/view">announced</a> that he and Marcel Molina jr. have signed up with Pragmatic Bookshelf to write <em>Pragmatic Rails Recipes: A Guide to Elegant Web Development.</em> The book would be a sequel for the probably first-ever Rails book, Dave Thomas&#8217;  <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/index.html"><em>Agile Web Development with Rails</em></a>, about to be published in July.</p>
<p>Only a few hours later Curt Hibbs comes up and tells on the Rails mailing list that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bruce Tate and David Geary (author of Core Java Server Faces, Core <span class="caps">JSTL</span>, and more) have signed with O&#8217;Reilly to write a &#8220;Rails Developer Notebook&#8221; (obviously one of O&#8217;Reilly&#8217;s new Developer Notebooks series).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These are really great news. The profound interest publishers like <a href="http://pragprog.com"><em>Pragmatic Programmers</em></a> and <a href="http://www.oreilly.com"><em>O&#8217;Reilly</em></a> are showing towards Rails is a clear sign that there is something worthwhile being done in the  community and that the framework won&#8217;t end up as just another one-night-wonder. We&#8217;re clearly on the roll!</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>O&#8217;Reilly Network has a great <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2005/03/10/basecamp.html">interview</a> with Jason Fried, president of <a href="http://www.37signals.com">37signals</a>. Something Jason says in the interview really resonates with me (also quoted by <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000420.html"><span class="caps">DHH</span></a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you don&#8217;t trust your developer to choose the right environment, then how can you trust him to build the best application? Trust is critical here. And, further, why would you dare impact your developer&#8217;s morale by throwing him or her into a language where he can&#8217;t be as productive or as satisfied? You only get good work from people who enjoy doing the work. I&#8217;ll take a happy average programmer over a disgruntled, frustrated master programmer any day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t understand how any other attitude would make any sense, and still this globe is full of CTO&#8217;s &#8220;knowing&#8221; what&#8217;s the best for their developers. I&#8217;m privileged to work with clients like <a href="http://www.aaltonenshoe.com">Aaltonen Shoefactory</a> who trust in my opinion to choose the best tools and solutions for my and, ultimately, <em>their</em> needs. A great <strong>thank you</strong> for that.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m back from a training camp in Madeira. The week was a pleasure, although I didn&#8217;t feel really snappy in the whole week (probably due to the preceding <a href="http://www.finlandiahiihto.fi/english/index2.htm">Finlandia-hiihto</a>).</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s some random thoughts about Madeira and the camp (I&#8217;m still too tired to get anything organized on paper):</p>
<ul>
	<li>There&#8217;s only a few orienteering maps from Madeira but they are invariably in very nice terrains with breath-taking views.<br />
!http://photos3.flickr.com/6178810_01815ce541_m.jpg (Madeira orienteering terrain)!:http://www.flickr.com/photos/jarkko/6178810/ </li></li>
	<li>The surroundings of Funchal are very crowded with a lot of traffic. Therefore, about the only good running training facilities in the neighbourhood are the (short) Lido street promenade and the (longer) &#8220;urban levada&#8221;, <em>Levada dos Piornais_, starting right above Lido.<br />
!http://photos7.flickr.com/6178612_0aa4f7fab4</em>m.jpg (City levada in Lido)!:http://www.flickr.com/photos/jarkko/6178612/ </li></li>
	<li>Levadas, the narrow irrigation canals Madeira is full of, are quite well suited for training. They are often really narrow, tho, and hover over 50-meter cliffs so don&#8217;t even think about doing hard trainings or intervals along them.<br />
!http://photos5.flickr.com/6178700_466ba85832_m.jpg (Mats looking down from a levada)!:http://www.flickr.com/photos/jarkko/6178700/ </li></li>
	<li>You shouldn&#8217;t miss the peninsula of Ponta de SÃ£o Lourenco in the far east end of Madeira. The place is perfect for a full day trip or (as we did) for an orienteering training extended with jogging to the end of the peninsula. Be prepared to some really strong winds, though, and leave your cowboy hats at the hotel.<br />

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I will not be presenting at <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/os2005/"><span class="caps">OSCON</span></a> like <a href="http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000416.html">others</a> nor even at a <a href="http://jamisbuck.org/jamis/blog.cgi/programming/ruby/Rails%20Presentation_20050218124909.tx">Java Users Group</a> but I <strong>will</strong> be giving a guest lecture on <a href="http://rubyonrails.com">Rails</a> for students of <em>Programming Hypermedia</em> at the <a href="http://matriisi.ee.tut.fi/hypermedia/en/">Hypermedia Lab</a> of <a href="http://www.tut.fi/public/index.cfm?siteid=32">Tampere University of Technology</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, I&#8217;m thrilled. And already tense as hell. It will be my first real talk if you don&#8217;t count the seminars in school. But, standing on the shoulders of giants (and talking about something I&#8217;ve fell in love with), I feel I just can&#8217;t fail.</p>
<p>Oh, and the last October&#8217;s edition of <a href="http://www.designinflight.com/">Design In-Flight</a>, the excellent design magazine distributed as pdf, <a href="http://7nights.com/asterisk/">D. Keith Robinson</a> has a take for first-time speakers.</p>
<p>Stay tuned. The lecture will be on April 13th. I hope I can get someone to tape the two-hour session but even if not, I will make the slides and notes available here. And if you happen to be in Tampere on that inevitably glorious day, why won&#8217;t you sneak in the hall S3 and give it a whirl. Maybe you&#8217;ll be bitten, too.</p></div>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Automatic handling of creation time and modification time in ActiveRecord.</strong> Just put two timestamp fields in your database, <code>created_at</code> and <code>updated_at</code>, and you&#8217;re done. The fields will be automatically used by ActiveRecord whenever a new object is saved for the first time or updated. You don&#8217;t have to worry about them anymore.</li>
	<li><strong>Optimistic locking.</strong> Just read about this one in the mailing list. Add a field called <code>lock_version</code> (integer) into your table and ActiveRecord will use optimistic locking for that table from now on, as long as you put a hidden field with that version to your edit form.<br />
What does it mean? When you start editing an object, its <code>lock_version</code> is read from the database. As you submit your changes, your <code>lock_version</code> is compared to the current one in the database and if the db version has been bumbed up, your submittal is not accepted and an exception is raised. You (as an application developer) can then inform the user (hey, that was you, too!) about the situation and show her the latest version . Preferably show her her changes, too, otherwise she has to write the whole story again. You don&#8217;t want that, do you?<br />
</li></ol></li>
</ol>
<p>Rails is full of this kind of candies, so it&#8217;s worth exploring the <a href="http://rails.rubyonrails.com"><span class="caps">API</span> documentation</a>. It&#8217;s still a fairly moving target so I try to keep popping these &#8216;rubies&#8217; up to the surface as I discover them.</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Boing Boing <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/02/10/mpaa_shuts_down_loki.html">reports</a> that <span class="caps">MPAA</span> has been shutting down and <em>taking over</em> several BitTorrent hubs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Reader Brad Clarke says, &#8220;Taking down a site is one thing but putting up their own content has <span class="caps">GOT</span> to be illegal. He&#8217;s to hoping they finally went too far.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reminds me of the Monday night when I went to watch <a href="http://teamamerica.com/">Team America</a> in the local cinema. Among the pre-movie commercials there was an &#8220;infomercial&#8221; from <span class="caps">MPAA</span>. The shoot showed several &#8220;normal-life&#8221; crimes like burglary and then ended with huge letters stating that &#8220;<strong><span class="caps">DOWNLOADING</span> IS A <span class="caps">CRIME</span></strong>&#8221;.</p>
<p>The problem? It&#8217;s not. Distributing copyrighted material (other than fair use) is a crime in Finland, downloading is <strong>not</strong>. That seems to be a fact conveniently &#8220;forgotten&#8221; by <span class="caps">MPAA</span> (and <span class="caps">RIAA</span>, <span class="caps">BSA</span>, you name it&#8230;) in <em>every possible occasion</em>. Anyone smell double standards here?</p></div>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Both <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/02/06/shmoo_group_exploit_.html">BoingBoing</a> and <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/02/07/browsers_idn_spoofing/">The Register</a> report about a security exploit affecting most modern browsers. The vulnerability makes it possible to create links that look ok in the browser (like www.paypal.com) but that actually lead to another site that has non-7-bit-ascii characters in their address. <a href="http://secunia.com">Secunia</a> has prepared a <a href="http://secunia.com/multiple_browsers_idn_spoofing_test/">test</a> you can run to see if your browser is vulnerable to the exploit.</p>
<p>In the BoingBoing story, they tell about a way to secure Firefox by changing a config parameter. However, in a later update they say that the fix doesn&#8217;t stand restarting the browser. Another update <a href="http://users.tns.net/~skingery/weblog/2005/02/permanent-fix-for-shmoo-group-exploit.html">tells</a> how to make the fix permanent. The fix is for Windows users, so here&#8217;s a rewrite of it for all Mac Firefox people:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Exit Firefox</li>
	<li>Open ~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/ ###.default (or default.###) in finder (### being a number of random characters)</li>
	<li>Backup compreg.dat</li>
	<li>Open compreg.dat in a text editor (right-click =&gt; open with&#8230; =&gt; other =&gt; select textedit or some other text editor)</li>
	<li>Scroll down to [<span class="caps">CONTRACTIDS</span>] section and find this row: @mozilla.org/network/idn-service;1,{62b778a6-bce3-456b-8c31-2865fbb68c91}</li>
	<li>change the 1 after idn-service; to 0, so that the line will be @mozilla.org/network/idn-service;0,{62b778a6-bce3-456b-8c31-2865fbb68c91}</li>
	<li>Save the file and restart Firefox. Navigate to <a href="http://secunia.com/multiple_browsers_idn_spoofing_test/">Secunia&#8217;s test</a> and run the test. If you get a &#8220;not found&#8221; error, you should be all fine.</li>
</ol>
<p>I&#8217;ve tested the fix and it works fine for me, but I can&#8217;t promise it will for you. So stay tuned for security updates. And don&#8217;t forget Safari is vulnerable to this exploit, too, as is Opera.</p></div>
