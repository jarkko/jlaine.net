    Mens Sana in Corpore Sano</h4>
<cite>"A sound mind in a sound body"</cite> (D. Iunius Iuvenalis). That's
    been my driving force since the cradle, whether I knew it or not. The quiet moments
    lying around are nice, too, but being in one place too long just makes me crazy. 
    <p>So I do sports. I run, play, ski, drive a bike or take a long hike every now and
    then, about every day, that is. I'd love to say that I'm excercising just for the fun
    of it, but I have to admit that there lies other reasons, too. It's nice to be good.
    It would be great to be even better.</p>
    <h4>Orienteering</h4>
    One of the oldest sports in the world, <a
     href="http://www.the-spa.com/tony.maniscalco/odef.htm">orienteering</a>, is also one of
    the least known. It has it's roots in the Nordic countries as an army sport. Nowadays
    it's one of the more popular sports in Finland as well as in other Nordic countries.
    They also tend to dominate the world elite orienteering with Switzerland, Russia and
    a few other countries. In the World Orienteering Championships 2001 in my current
    hometown <a
     href="http://www.tampere.fi/english/index.html">Tampere</a> Finland was the most
    successful nation with three golden and a total of eight medals. 
    <p>Orienteering has been my sports number one since 14 years old. Two years later I
    went to a sports high school in <a
     href="http://www.turku.fi/english/">Turku</a> far far (25 km) away from <a
     href="http://www.parainen.fi/index.phtml?page_id=2017">home</a>.</p>
    <p>I've been quite successful in orienteering, mostly in junior classes. My best
    merits are Finnish championship in relay in M20-class and 7th place in the <a
     href="http://www.jukola.com/?kieli=eng&amp;id=30" title="Read what Jukola is all about">Jukola</a> relay in 2001.</p>
    <h4>Other sports</h4>
<p>    While orienteering has become my most important hobby (and beyond), it has by no
    means been the only nor the first sports I've made during my short life. When younger
    I played a lot of football and ice hockey, as well as tennis and volleyball with my
    father. I was also interested in athletics, with most success in middle and long
    distances. </p>
    <p>Life's too short to mention here all the sports I've come across but believe me
    when I say there's plenty of them. And still I haven't found sports that I wouldn't
    like. Sadly I often have to admit that there's no time to do them all but, heck, you
    got to make choices. Yet I haven't been able to do mine, god knows if I ever
    will...</p>
