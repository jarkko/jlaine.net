Caching is turned off by default in the development environment. If you want to try it out before switching to full production mode, change the following line in <code>[yourapp]/config/environments/development.rb</code>:

<pre><code>ActionController::Base.perform_caching = false</code></pre>

to

<pre><code>ActionController::Base.perform_caching = true</code></pre>
