title: We'll meet in Reboot 7
---
"Reboot 7":http://reboot.dk/reboot7/show/HomePage in Copenhagen has now been officially announced and what a happening it will be! The "speaker list":http://reboot.dk/reboot7/show/Participants consists of such guys as "Doug Bowman":http://www.stopdesign.com, "Cory Doctorow":http://www.boingboing.net/ and "Jimmy Wales":http://www.jimmywales.com/, not to mention "Rails":http://www.rubyonrails.com and "Basecamp":http://www.basecamphq.com heroes "David Heinemeier Hansson":http://www.loudthinking.com and "Jason Fried":http://www.37signals.com/svn/.

I also got an unofficial confirmation from David that they will be giving the "Building of Basecamp":http://www.37signals.com/workshop-basecamp.php workshop the day before Reboot. Geez, I have been "waiting":http://www.43things.com/things/view/77493 for that announcement like Christmas. Can't wait for the day the registration begins. If the success is anywhere near the previous workshops, there's not many days to spend before the gig is sold out.

Unfortunately I have a wedding on Saturday that I really have (and want) to attend, so I will miss the second day talks and the Saturday night ceremonies. Even then the whole show sounds like something I won't forget very soon.
