title: Invasion of Rails Books
---
Announcements about Rails-related books seem to be popping up like mushrooms in the rain today. First, Scott Barron (and later "DHH":http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000426.html) "announced":http://scott.elitists.net/scott/pragmatic-rails-recipes/view that he and Marcel Molina jr. have signed up with Pragmatic Bookshelf to write _Pragmatic Rails Recipes: A Guide to Elegant Web Development._ The book would be a sequel for the probably first-ever Rails book, Dave Thomas'  "_Agile Web Development with Rails_":http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/index.html, about to be published in July.

Only a few hours later Curt Hibbs comes up and tells on the Rails mailing list that

bq. Bruce Tate and David Geary (author of Core Java Server Faces, Core JSTL, and more) have signed with O'Reilly to write a "Rails Developer Notebook" (obviously one of O'Reilly's new Developer Notebooks series).

These are really great news. The profound interest publishers like "_Pragmatic Programmers_":http://pragprog.com and "_O'Reilly_":http://www.oreilly.com are showing towards Rails is a clear sign that there is something worthwhile being done in the  community and that the framework won't end up as just another one-night-wonder. We're clearly on the roll!
