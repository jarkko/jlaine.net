Sorry for my absence from here. I spent last week in "Vuokatti":http://www.vuokatti.fi/lang/toiminto.php?mid=4_127&la=uk, an XC skiing paradise in Northeastern Finland. With no internet connection. That can be a relaxing experience, mind you. Well, ok, I checked my email every now and then with my cellphone, but with no serious job-related thoughts involved.

Anyway, the week was pretty productive. 26,5 hours and 359 kilometers of training in 8 days is pretty near my training record. And two of those days were travel days. The weather was excellent, most of the week between 0 and -10 Â°C and sunny.
