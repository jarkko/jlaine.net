Wednesday really seemed to be too good a day for me as the following days have been pretty painful. It seems that I've been carrying a "dermoid cyst":http://www.answers.com/dermoid+cyst&r=67 (a kind of benign tumor) under my coccyx whole my life but this week of all time it decided to inflame, probably after it got irritated by some heavy (non-xml) sit-ups during a work-out. I tried to bite it and run last night a training with the help of some painkillers. During the night I had problems to get sleep because of the pain and after I caught quite high fever this afternoon I had to accept the fact that I won't be participating any competitions this weekend. With the help of Maria's father I got a time in the local emergency room and they literally cut a hole in my butt.

After some serious yelling and pain the tumor was emptied of about a litre of pus (or so it seemed. I wasn't able to see the operation, for obvious reasons) and they plugged the hole with a roll of gauze tissue so that all the matter can exit the tumor in the next two days. Needless to say, I don't really feel like sitting in an office chair right now so I guess I'll be catching on my backlog of reading and movie watching this weekend.

Take care.
