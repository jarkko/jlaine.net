title: Start from the Heart
---
My friend "Lars Pind":http://pinds.com/ is slowly migrating himself from a software developer to a coach. His new startup is called "Start from the Heart":http://startfromtheheart.com/, where Lars tries to help people start companies that represent their true soul. The guiding principle behind Start from the Heart is that there should be a deeper meaning in the business you pursue than just the money. As exactly that has been a driving force behind us at "dotherightthing.com":http://dotherightthing.com, it's no wonder the premise of SftH really resonated with me.

Lars is putting up "a series of exercises":http://startfromtheheart.com/blog/ for the participants of the program and giving out them for free. I worked through "the first assignment":http://startfromtheheart.com/heroes/ and must say that it's a great one, getting a smile on your face. If you're thinking about starting your own company (or have ever contemplated it), I would highly recommend giving Start from the Heart a try. I'm certainly enjoying it from the bottom of my heart (no pun intended).
