Apologies for my few days' absence from here. Things have not stagnated, however, I was just running the Finnish champs in military troop orienteering this week (which we -- coincidentally -- won ;). Have to go to drink some coffee and eat a piece of cake with a few generals now, I'll continue my changeover later.
