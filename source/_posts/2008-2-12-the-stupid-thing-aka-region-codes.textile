title: The best of times, the worst of times
---
I'm kind of sad that Blu-ray has taken the lead in the next generation digital video disc race, and that has little to do with the fact that "I don't really like Sony":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_BMG#Controversy. The reason "the lurking death of HD DVD":http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080211-best-buy-netflix-join-hd-dvd-dogpile.html makes me really sad is that while it has smaller capacity than BD, it has one thing really going for it: *it's void of one of the pests of modern times: regional codes.*

"Jeremy Keith recently wrote":http://adactio.com/journal/1404 about DVD's and Wii games that he bought during his Christmas trip to US _that he cannot use_ because they are limited to be played only by a player with the US region code. Now, there are region code-free players available, but that only makes the whole scheme more pointless.

Now, with HD DVD being free of the region codes, we could have gotten rid of them once and for all. However, with Blu-ray seemingly winning the war, we seem to be stuck with the same hassle into the unforeseeable future. And people wonder why Pirate Bay is the #1 movie distribution channel in Europe these days...
