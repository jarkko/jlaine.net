title: ! 'SOLD: 2 pcs 1GB Kingston RAMs for 1.67GHz Powerbook G4''s'
---
h2. Update: SOLD OUT

I have two Kingston ValueRAM 1GHz modules ("KTA-PB533/1G":http://www.ec.kingston.com/ecom/configurator_new/partsinfo.asp?ktcpartno=KTA-PB533/1G) for 1.67GHz Powerbooks (both 15 and 17 inch) for sale. I bought them as upgrades for my upcoming 17-inch Powerbook, but the introduction of MacBook Pro changed my plans and now I don't have use for these modules anymore. They sell around &euro;125 in Finland at the moment ($140 in US). I'll sell mine for &euro;85/each (including VAT 22%) + shipping (which isn't much since they're small and light).

The modules are unused and in unopened, sealed packages. They come with the standard 5 year Kingston guarantee. Sold on first come, first serve basis.
