title: Call for Aid
---
"Airbag":http://www.airbagindustries.com/ -Greg wrote a thought-provoking "article":http://www.airbagindustries.com/archives/006783.php about the aid for the victims of the tsunami disaster in South-East Asia. As he also deliberately shared his help icons, I'm going to put two on this page, too.

Here's what we're going to do with Maria: As one commenter in Greg's post proposed, we're not going to buy any drinks for the New Year's eve. On top of that, we leave firecrackers in the store shelves, a common gesture in Finland. Instead, we donate 70 euros to "Finnish Red Cross catastroph aid":http://www.redcross.fi/lahjoita/. That's not a whole lot, but we're both still students.

And to all (two) Finnish orienteers who are reading this blog, there's a campaign in "Suunnistus.net":http://suunnistus.net/apps/avustusmaksut/admin/ to raise more aid for the Finnish catastroph fund. Please consider mobilizing your club for the effort.
