For some reason some files in my CVS checkout sometimes end up without write-permissions for myself. I can easily change them in emacs shell buffer, but if they're already open in emacs, I still get <code>&lt;buffer is read-only&gt;</code> nags. Here's how to get rid of that: <code>meta x toggle-read-only</code> or <code>C-x C-q</code>.

Thanks to "Andrew Grumet":http://www.grumet.net/weblog/ and blighty at #openacs who helped me out with this.
