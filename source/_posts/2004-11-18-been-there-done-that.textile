I've now officially made my first purchase from iTunes Music Store. I bought the whole "Rammstein":http://www.rammstein.com/ album _Reise, Reise_. I would've liked to buy the physical album (since I bought the whole album anyway) but couldn't find it from the Amsterdam airport. So I just grabbed it from iTMS. Convenient. Very convenient.

However, I still think the most of my iTMS öhases in the future will be individualögs. If I want the whole album, I also want the leaflets. -And as the store has now landed in Finland, how about making some contracts with Finnish music producers?- Wow, they got me, there already is some Finnish music. Not a whole lot, though, so it would certainly be an aspect where they could improve. And for christ's sake, please don't mix ö with o. If I search for songs from _Yö_, I really wouldn't like to browse through all yo yo rap son
