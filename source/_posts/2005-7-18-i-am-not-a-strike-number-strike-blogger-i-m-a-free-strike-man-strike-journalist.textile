After recent "events":http://talkleft.com/new_archives/009971.html "Aaron Schwartz":http://www.aaronsw.com "declares":http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/newethics he's no more writing a blog but an online magazine. In accordance, he writes up his new regime with ten theses. The first rule: "??"Like all major newspapers":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fact_checker, there will be no factchecking.??" Read the whole "hilarious article":http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/newethics.

That said, I just got a notice about a bag full of books waiting for me in the local post office. Won't complain. I can't right now think of a better thing to do than to retreat to the summer cottage to peruse "Cradle to Cradle":http://www.mcdonough.com/cradle_to_cradle.htm and "The Best Software Writing I":http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/BestSoftwareWriting.html (containing pieces by, among others, Aaron, "why the lucky stiff":http://whytheluckystiff.net/, "Clay Shirky":http://shirky.com/,  "Cory Doctorow":http://boingboing.net, "John Gruber":http://daringfireball.net/ and "Paul Graham":http://www.paulgraham.com).
