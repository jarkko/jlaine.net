...I'll spend my next Midsummer eve in Chicago. "RailsConf":http://railsconf.org/ just opened its registration and boy what an event it will be! Keynotes not just from the two Rails-Davids, but also from "Paul Graham":http://paulgraham.com/bio.html and "Martin Fowler":http://www.martinfowler.com/. Judging by the amount of interest the conf has gathered, it will be sold out sooner rather than later. So book your place in time. I'll try to gather a Nordic Rails brigade that would take a common flight (like "the _DHH_ flight":http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000417.html from Copenhagen) and maybe share rooms during the event.

This will also be my first trip to the New Continent, which makes it all even more interesting. I think I'm going to spend a few days more in there, either before or after the conference. So if you have some holiday suggestions, please do share them. The only real thing I know about Illinois are "The Land of Lincoln" license plates we got from the local gas station as kids. Oh, and that Tuomo Ruutu plays in the Black Hawks.
