title: ! 'Note to self: when autotest fails...'

I just run into the following error when running autotest within a Rails app:

<pre><code>

It turned out I had typed "sudo gem update zentest" to get the latest version of the gem. However, the correct way would have been to use the camel-cased version ZenTest. The funny thing is, that if you run the command in lower case (like I'm use to do with RubyGems), you _will_ get ZenTest, it's just version 3.5.0 (as opposed to 3.8 that I supposedly got).

So here's hoping that the next time I do the same mistake, this page will pop up from the big G.
