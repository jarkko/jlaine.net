The first-ever Ruby/Rails conference in Finland, "Frozen Rails":http://frozenrails.eu, is going to take place May 7th in Helsinki. The speaker lineup is top notch, including three "Rails core team":http://rubyonrails.org/core members and the inimitable "Chris Wanstrath":http://defunkt.github.com/. For an unknown reason, in the midst of these high profile guys, a random guy from Tampere has ended up in the speaker list. Yours truly has the honorable (and somewhat frightening) job to wrap up the conference with an ending talk.

My talk is tentatively titled "Of Perfection, Perfectionism and Perfect Web Apps". It will be less of a technical talk and more a critical, personal, humorous and hopefully entertaining performance about the previous decade spent writing various kinds of web sites and apps.

If you still haven't secured your ticket, hurry up! The 99â‚¬ "early bird price":http://frozenrails.eu/information#pricing goes out tonight.
