Your freedom to carry a gun messes with my freedom to walk around without fear.

Your freedom to “stand your ground” with force is at odds with my [freedom to run anywhere in the woods freely](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_to_roam).

Your freedom to refuse to pay taxes diminishes my freedom to fall ill without the fear of it bankrupting me.

There are many kinds of freedoms. Yours might not be the only ones or the right ones even though you're inclined to think so. Neither do mine.
