title: Going to EuroOSCON
---
I will start a week-long journey today which will include first an orienteering relay in southwestern Finland and then "EuroOSCON":http://conferences.oreillynet.com/eurooscon/ in Amsterdam.

My "tutorial":http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/eurooscon/view/e_sess/7445 in EuroOSCON is my first *big* presentation so you can imagine I have some butterflies in my stomach already. The flexible path and show-don't-tell theme of the tutorial hopefully makes it a bit easier to survive the three-hour gig. I've practiced the whole tutorial already quite a few times and still have a few days left to hone the last glitches. Needless to say, I'm pretty excited.

As my tutorial will be a whirlwind tour through Rails, it pays off to at least know what's Rails is about before the tutorial. Coincidentally, ONLamp.com has just launched "Curt Hibbs's":http://blog.curthibbs.us/ article ""What Is Ruby on Rails":http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2005/10/13/what_is_rails.html" that does a great job explaining _what_ Rails is. My tutorial will then tell you _how_ that will benefit you.
