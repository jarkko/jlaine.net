We had the luxury of spending six weeks around New Zealand in last February and March, including a visit to "Webstock '09":http://www.webstock.org.nz/. This year's conference is about to start within hours, and while I won't be able to attend this time, I will celebrate the event by publishing the SVG New Zealand map I produced for the travelogue book of our trip (click the map to get to the SVG version):

The map is based on "this map":http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:New_Zealand_location_map.svg on Wikipedia Commons, converted to the only true Kiwi colors, #000 and #FFF.

Since the original SVG file is published under the "Creative Commons":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/en:Creative_Commons "Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported":http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en license, that's what I'm going with as well. So do what you want with the map, but don't forget the virus.
