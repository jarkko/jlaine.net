Congrats to Sami Korjus and my cousin "Jussi SyrjÃ¤":http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1533154/ for "securing a spot":http://www.indiewire.com/ots/2007/12/park_city_08_to.html for their short film "Harvest Time":http://imdb.com/title/tt0997056/ at the "Sundance Festival":http://www.sundance.org/festival/. I've seen the film now twice, in its premiere in the "Tampere Film Festival":http://www.tamperefilmfestival.fi/2007/eng/index.htm last year (where it "won the special prize":http://www.filmfestivalworld.com/blog/Festival/Tampere_Film_Festival/Post/109/#comments) and last week on the national tv, and the mojo hasn't worn off. It was one of the few movies in the festival shot on real 35mm film and the same quality can be seen throughout the whole film. If you're into black comedies and heading to Sundance, I heartily recommend "giving it a shot":http://www.sundance.org/festival/film_events/details1.asp?filmid=08F0255&filmtype=s&keepThis=true&TB_iframe=true&height=480&width=900.
