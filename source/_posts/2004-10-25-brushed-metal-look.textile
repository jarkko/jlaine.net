bq. Letâ€™s say I have a Safari window and an iChat window open side-by-side, with no overlap. I think the Safari window is active, but itâ€™s actually the iChat window. I type Cmd-T to open a new tab in Safari, but instead, I get the Font Panel in iChat.

Agreed. Just closed an iChat window instead of a Safari window with Cmd-w. Thankfully I have autologging enabled in iChat.
