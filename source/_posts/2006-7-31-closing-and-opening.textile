title: Closing... and Opening
---
After a magnificent week sunbathing and orienteering in "Gotland":http://www.gotland.se/imcms/9646, we finished the week by moving our stuff from the well-served "jlaine.net mansion":http://beta.plazes.com/plaze/33120826ca6d5d7cb9dcee6538b221c1/ to our new home. I always tend to be really tired after week-long training camps, but topping it off by two days of hauling things over has got the better of me. I'm thus closing this office now, wishing for two things:

# A long night sleep.
# A fast broadband delivery to the new apt. Until then, I will be heading a mobile office from cafes and universities around "Tampere":http://www.43places.com/places/view/700129.

Oh, and did I mention the just ripened raspberries in our new garden?

*[UPDATE]* I finally settled on an ADSL provider and the connection should be live mid next week. The lead time for an installation ranged from a decent 9 days to a staggering 6 weeks, which is pretty amazing for a flip of a switch (there is no work needed on site). I've been burned by the unreliability of ADSL a few times before, so I was contemplating getting a business broadband and circumventing the aging phone lines altogether. However, with prices starting from 400&euro;/month for a 4/4Mb connection I decided I would settle for an 8/1Mb ADSL (for 10% of the price) for now and see whether the service has gotten any better.
