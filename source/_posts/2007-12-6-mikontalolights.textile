What would a bunch of geeks do while their dorm highrise is under renovation? Build "the world's biggest LED screen":http://www.mikontalolights.fi/en/technics/, of course.

One of the most infamous student dorm houses in my hometown and whole Finland, "Mikontalo":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikontalo, is finally put under hammer and renovated to meet the standards of the third millennium. While the construction work is underway, a bunch of TUT geeks decided to get something more out of the works:

bq. The object of MIKONTALOLIGHTS is to create the world's physically largest colored graphics platform by using the windows of Mikontalo's D-staircase as light pixels. The platform is used to play Tetris and other games and present demos created by the students of Tampere University of Technology.

Here's a video of the grand opening, including rounds of Space Invaders and Tetris (controlled with a mobile phone, of course). Times Square, beware!
