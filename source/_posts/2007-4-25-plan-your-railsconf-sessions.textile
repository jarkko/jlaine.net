title: Plan your RailsConf sessions
---
All the cool kids are heading to "RailsConf":http://conferences.oreillynet.com/rails/ in less than a month from now. Dr. Nic Williams, the man who's obviously found a way to stretch the concept of time as we know it, has now whipped up "MyConfPlan":http://myconfplan.com, a free service you can use to plan your conferences and share the plans with others.

Check the site up! "My very preliminary and incomplete plan for RailsConf is open for review":http://myconfplan.com/conferences/RailsConf2007/users/jarkko.
