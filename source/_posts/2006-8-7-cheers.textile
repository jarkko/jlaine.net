Late as always:

Congrats "Rails":http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2006/7/26/rails-is-2-years-old and thank you, "David":http://www.loudthinking.com, for having been able to share the "two years of beauty and passion":http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000594.html. There's nothing better than a guilty pleasure. Here's for many more years to come!
