title: ! 'New on dotherightthing.com: Atom feeds'
---
We just went live with a "three week tuneup":http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch15_One_Month_Tuneup.php at "dotherightthing.com":http://dotherightthing.com. The main update is the introduction of a wide variety of "Atom feeds":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_feed. I just wrote an "in-depth article about all the different feeds available on the dotherighthing.com blog":, but let me get a bit more geeky here.

We're using "Ruby on Rails":http://www.rubyonrails.org and the "Simply Restful":http://ryandaigle.com/articles/2006/08/01/whats-new-in-edge-rails-simply-restful-support-and-how-to-use-it stuff in it so adding an Atom representation for a resource like entry, company or user is dead simple: just add a new response type with respond_to:

<pre><code>  respond_to do |type|
    type.html do
      # normal stuff
    end
    type.atom do
      # render the atom feed
    end
  end
</code></pre>

Now, when someone requests the action with type atom (e.g. "http://dotherightthing.com/companies/starbucks.atom":http://dotherightthing.com/companies/starbucks.atom), the code inside @type.atom@ will be executed. However, the niceties don't stop there. The new "resource_feeder":http://www.ryandaigle.com/articles/2006/09/14/whats-new-in-edge-rails-get-your-rss-atom-feeds-for-free plugin makes everything even easier. We don't need to setup a specific template for the feeds at all, all we have to do is to specify some options that don't match the standard and then call render_atom_feed_for:

<pre><code>  feed_options = { :feed => 
                      {:title => "dotherightthing.com #{params[:sort]} entries",
                       :link => entries_url(:sort => params[:sort])},
                   :item => {:description => :body_html},
                   :class => Entry }

                   ...

  type.atom do
    render_atom_feed_for(@entries, feed_options)
  end
</code></pre>

And that's it! 

Another great thing about Simply Restful is that all the url's are extremely logical. A user profile can be viewed at "http://dotherightthing.com/users/jarkko":http://dotherightthing.com/users/jarkko, a feed for his content is at "http://dotherightthing.com/users/jarkko.atom":http://dotherightthing.com/users/jarkko.atom. The same is true for companies: "http://dotherightthing.com/companies/apple":http://dotherightthing.com/companies/apple â†’ "http://dotherightthing.com/companies/apple.atom":http://dotherightthing.com/companies/apple.atom.

Gotta love the RESTful features in Rails!
