title: A touch of Mark II

*A word of caution*: this entry has no other meaning than to show off.

Yes, that is my hand holding a brand new "Canon EOS-1Ds Mark II":http://www.canon-europe.com/For_Home/Product_Finder/Cameras/Digital_SLR/EOS_1Ds_markII/index.asp?ComponentID=230304&SourcePageID=164046. The bad news: it's not mine (with the voice of "Austin Powers":http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118655/quotes). We were visiting Maria's parents after a while and I finally got a chance to play a bit around with my father-in-law-candidate's new baby.

So how does it feel? Like a brick. I'm telling ya baby, that's a helluva pack of hardware. I never touched an EOS-1, but this is certainly heavier than an EOS-3. Of course it has the vertical hand grip built-in, but dragging an EOS-1Ds with e.g. the "70-200mm/2.8 lense":http://www.canon-europe.com/For_Home/Product_Finder/Cameras/EF_Lenses/Image_Stabilization_Lenses/EF_70200mm_f28LIS_USM/ for a day sure beats a gym session.

I took a few quick photos with the camera (and another few of it) and posted them to a "Flickr set":http://www.flickr.com/photos/jarkko/sets/194680/. Nothing spectacular, I seem to a be a bit rusty after shooting too much with the wide focal area of a digital point'n'shoot. In 1Ds with default settings (especially with the "100mm macro lense":http://www.canon-europe.com/For_Home/Product_Finder/Cameras/EF_Lenses/Macro_Lenses/EF_100mm_f28_Macro_USM/) the area is so razor sharp and narrow that I seem to have missed the target in all but a few of the photos.

My "set":http://www.flickr.com/photos/jarkko/sets/194680/ was exported as medium jpeg's (that's 6MP, folks!) and even then the quality of the photos was astonishing. Can't wait to get a hold of the 16MP RAW files after a real shooting session, which I sure hope I can get arranged later this spring.
