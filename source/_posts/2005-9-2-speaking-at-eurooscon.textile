title: Speaking at EuroOSCON
---
Yay! Since "David":http://www.loudthinking.com won't make it to Monday's "Ruby on Rails tutorial":http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/eurooscon/view/e_sess/7445 in "EuroOSCON":http://conferences.oreillynet.com/eurooscon/ (17-20 October), I will step into his "nice shoes":http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000489.html and give the presentation. I'm both totally excited and nervous about the gig, but I'm sure the former will take over eventually.

That said, if you haven't yet registered for the first-ever EuroOSCON, it's about the time to do it now. But wait! Before you register, check out "this David's article":http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000498.html. It might be worth hard cash for you.

And when we're at it, here's the headshot my father-in-law candidate took for the presentation with his ""little toy":http://www.flickr.com/photos/jarkko/7796967/". Just so you know to run when you see me coming down the aisle.
