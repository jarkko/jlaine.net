title: New iMac in order
---
[UPDATE] The computer actually arrived in just one week. I guess we're just one helluva lucky bunch of folks. Or then Apple has sorted out its shortage of capacity.[/UPDATE]

Just went and bought a new "iMac":http://www.apple.com/imac/ for my parents this Monday. It's the 17" model with superdrive and 512MB RAM.

I'm pretty excited, not just because it probably means a lot fewer unpaid pc support person hours for me :) 

What puts me off a bit, though, is the shipping time of up to 8 weeks. Yeah, you heard it just right. I guess someone else is in the process of switching, too.
