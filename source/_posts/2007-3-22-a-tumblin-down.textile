title: A tumblin' down
---
Since blogging is now considered unfashionable, I "followed":http://project.ioni.st/ "the":http://technoweenie.tumblr.com/ "pack":http://tumble.toolmantim.com/ and started my own tumblelog, "Forest for the Trees":http://forest.jlaine.net/. OK, the main reason was probably how goddamn easy the peeps at "tumblr.com":http://www.tumblr.com/ have made everything. Kudos to them!

If you'd rather read more sports-oriented tumbling (and don't have problems with the Nordic languages), head on over to the "Moulin Rouge":http://mylly.punakone.fi/ brought to you by the mighty Red Machine.
