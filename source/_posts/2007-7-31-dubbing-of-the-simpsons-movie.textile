title: Dubbing of the Simpsons Movie
---
"Guan brings up":http://unicast.org/blog/1622 an interesting point about "The Simpsons Movie":http://imdb.com/title/tt0462538/. Just like in Denmark, it's distributed here both as original and a dubbed Finnish version. It's been common to dub films here that are clearly targeted at small children. However, dubbing Simpsons is interesting for two reasons:

# Just like in Denmark, Simpsons the series has never been dubbed in the Finnish TV. People, even the children, are used to the certain American voices the characters have.
# From what Iâ€™ve heard (I've yet to see the film) Simpsons the Movie is not really a childrenâ€™s movie at all, just like the series has never been aimed at children that can't yet read.
