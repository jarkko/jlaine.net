title: OpenACS Simulation 1.0 released
---
I'm proud to announce that we've released the version 1.0 of Simulation package for "OpenACS":http://openacs.org/ (Open Architecture Community System).

The major part of the package was developed by the nice folks at "Collaboraid":http://collaboraid.biz and my job was to finish the project and to make minor modifications to the system to get it ready for launch.

The Simulation package was developed for and financed by "Project RechtenOnline":http://www.rechtenonline.nl, a Dutch project to facilitate and improve virtual learning in law schools across the country.
