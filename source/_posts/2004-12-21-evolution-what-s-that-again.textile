title: Evolution? What's that again?
---
One thing that was widely accepted as a potential explanation for the result of US presidential elections was that "_almost half of Americans believe that God created human beings in their present form about 10,000 years ago_":http://www.gallup.com/poll/content/login.aspx?ci=14107. The same research revealed that only a third of Americans believe in Darwin's evolution theory.

Fair enough, but that was just a gallup, right? Dream on, pal. Now "a school district in Georgia":http://www.cobb.k12.ga.us/news/release0822.htm has ordered these stickers applied to science textbooks teaching Darwinism:

Scary, huh? I thought so, too. And what's really horrifying is that the mentioned school district is probably not alone. But now the scientists are striking back. Some guys at "Swarthmore":http://swarthmore.edu have prepared a "page of stickers":http://www.swarthmore.edu/NatSci/cpurrin1/textbookdisclaimers/, ready for you to print out and consume. Take a look, they're hilarious (in a sad clown way). This is one of my favorites:

bq. This book discusses *evolution*. President George W. Bush said, <q>On the issue of evolution, the verdict is still out on how God created the Earth.</q> Therefore, until 2008 this material shood be aproched with an open mind, studeed carefuly, and critcly consid'rd.
